M-E-T... \"Could be revolutionary!\" \"Is it really the fountain of youth?\nAre we onto something here?\" This isn't some sketchy supplement. It’s a real drug! It’s been used effectively \nby people with diabetes for decades to control their blood sugar. And it's cheap! It's really cheap. It's pennies per pill. It’s all in the news now because it's getting\npopular with another group of people with a lot of money, for a different purpose. So… to try to live longer, billionaires \nare taking a pill that costs pennies. Does it... work?? DR. NIR BARZILAI: This is important... Anti-aging generally has a bad name.\nIn anti-aging there are lots of charlatans. “What are you selling, mister? Snake oil?” “I tell you Mother, we’re cheating \nall the people, don’t you see?”  BARZILAI: \"You'll take this \nand you live forever.\"And if they die,   nobody sues them, right? So those are our enemy. That’s Dr. Nir Barzilai.\nHe’s the person you call if you have serious questions about aging. And he answered my first one right away... We're not talking about a... “fountain of youth”  \"The fountain of youth\" “The fountain of youth!” “You found no fountain of youth here!” BARZILAI: The thing that is not happening is taking an old person and making young, okay? Sorry. What researchers are actually trying to do is figure out if there's any way we can\ndelay the effects of aging. And I don’t mean wrinkles and gray hair. I mean about the chance you die. As you age, the chance you die goes up. Specifically, the chance you die from \nthese very common diseases goes up. Why does the chance of dying from cancer, \nheart disease, Alzheimer's go up with age? BARZILAI: We're thinking wrong about \nit. It's the biology of aging that   drives the disease. And if you stop this \nbiology of aging, you stop this disease. What he told me, and this took me a minute to wrap \nmy head around, is that: Our bodies accumulate   damage as time goes on. The diseases most of \nus die from spring from that damage - often in   ways we don’t totally understand. But if you could delay the damage somehow,   you could also delay the diseases, right? And \nmake it more likely you survive for longer. And in 2014, Dr. Barzilai happened on the \nresults of a very interesting study…\n  BARZILAI: This is a study from the UK where \nthey took 180,000 people approximately… They looked at three groups of people: \nPeople with diabetes taking metformin,   people with diabetes taking other drugs \nnot metformin, and people without diabetes   who weren’t taking any diabetes drugs. The people with diabetes who weren't\ntaking metformin had double the mortality - the number of \ndeaths - than the people without diabetes.\n  BARZILAI: But this is really what was cool: People \non metformin that were diabetics, were more obese,   they were more sick to begin with, had less \nmortality than people without diabetes. The fact that people with \ndiabetes who were taking metformin   died less than people\nWITHOUT diabetes is HUGE. But if you're applying that to anti-aging,\nthere are some really big caveats: First: These are correlations.\nThis is a retrospective study. They’re looking back at what happened, they weren't able to test whether metformin\nCAUSED it to happen. And second, the only people taking metformin\nin this study were people with diabetes. It’s not clear whether that whole\n“dying less” thing   applies to people without diabetes. And at this point,\nyou might be wondering “how does it even work?” Well, we know a lot about \nhow metformin works in people with diabetes:  When you eat or drink, your blood transports \nsugars to your cells to use as fuel.   In people with diabetes, these blood sugar levels \ncan get too high and metformin helps control that.   We have research on this going back decades to \nbefore metformin was first approved. We know a lot less about how it may or may not \nwork in people without diabetes for anti-aging.   One reason for that is, these days, it’s \nalready a cheap generic drug, which means   there’s not as much incentive for pharmaceutical \ncompanies to do expensive new research. Other studies show metformin does seem \nto have anti-aging effects in healthy   mice and worms. Which is interesting… But to know for sure whether\nmetformin can actually delay aging in most people,\nwe need more research. That’s what Dr. Barzilai is trying to do. \"Dr. Barzilai is about to launch\na new nationwide study!\" \"A proper randomized trial where\nthey give half the people metformin and half the people a placebo drug...\" \"So you're going to be hearing\na lot more about this in the future!\" BARZILAI: This is really the challenge \nthat I'm leading now. This is the TAME study.   TAME stands for Targeting Aging with Metformin. \nAnd the reason I’m doing that is not to repeat   the studies that I told you! It’s to really \nplan a study for the FDA to repurpose a drug   that we believe targets aging.  It’s hard to overstate how incredible  this would be if it works.  They’re trying to figure out if   aging is treatable.  if something can push back\nthe accumulation of damage, and push back the diseases\nthat kill the most of us.  And if that “something” isn’t some\ncrazy million-dollar thing   but a drug that is already on the market and \nalready affordable for many, many people. I get surprisingly emotional \nthinking about this topic. \"That!\" \"That! Is a camera!\" Really, I... genuinely can’t think of anything that I would want \nmore than more time with the people I love. In the meantime, whether or not you wanna \ntake metformin or I do boils down to our   assessment of 3 different factors: The first is, what you think of\nthe existing studies  (not the TAME trial, because \nit probably won’t be done for a while) The second is how urgent aging actually feels \nto you. That’s a very personal choice. The third is how you weigh your perceived \nbenefits against the side effects… BARZILAI: There's very common side effects in \nthe first week of use. You feel early satiety,   you're not hungry. You might have kind of \nupset stomach. You might have diarrhea. It also impacts how your body \nresponds to exercise. BARZILAI: When you exercise with or without \nmetformin, your muscle will have the same   increased capacity, but the \nmuscle wouldn't be as big. Ok. Would I have diarrhea for a \nweek and be less good at exercise   if I could live 5 years longer?\nYes. Absolutely. Would I opt in for that if I weren’t\npretty sure it would work?  No, probably not. So the people in the news right now\nwho are taking metformin for anti-aging, without \ndiabetes, are making a specific calculation:   “We don’t want to wait for more studies, \nwe’re happy with the studies we have.   We don’t mind these side effects too much, and aging \nfeels pretty urgent. We’re getting older.” You know, I’ve been struggling a little bit \nas a journalist working on this piece. Because on the one hand, I really want to\npresent information that experts tell me is important and valuable for the future. And on the other hand, I really don’t \nwant anyone to go take a medication   because they watched a YouTube video! I personally don’t take metformin, that’s how my calculation came out.\nI want to wait for more studies. But metformin isn’t the only option being studied. Researchers are looking at more \nand more drugs for anti-aging effects. If we figure out that any option meaningfully\ndelays the effects of aging in most people that is too huge to ignore or scoff at. 18 million people die of\nheart disease every year. 10 million people die of cancer. 55 million people have \nAlzheimers or other dementias. Some of those people are in my family, NONNA: \"It's a perfect picture of him...\" are my loved ones. Some, I imagine, are yours. And I can’t help but imagine what I would do with more time.",

        "description": "I've always been a big fan of Arrivals in basketball.",
        "text": "I've always been a big fan of Arrivals in basketball. Times when the stage has been set for a potential superstar to elevate their game, to grab a moment by the lapels and introduce themselves to the world. You know, the old Lupe fiasco, cliche. If you are who you say you are, a superstar, have no fear. That's what it felt like to be in Las Vegas in early October when the French Phenom, Victor Winman-Yama, took the stage for the first time in front of an American audience and, without rages physical tools, and a mind-meltingly skillful performance, addressed the growing hype around him. All that chatter that you've heard about a French teenager who supposedly implausible tall and phenomenally skilled? Doctor. A few years ago, I randomly saw Jesse Eisenberg at a local pinball bar, at 5'7 with a slight build, I thought, oh, okay. Laying eyes on Victor for the first time, in person, and at eye level, was on the other end of the in-person first impression spectrum. I felt like Alan Grant, seeing a rocky resource for the first time. And then to see him so cool, he confidently rides to the occasion against the G League Ignite with a highlight-heavy display of improbable blocks, skillful finishes around the rim, and a cascade of jumpers from nearly everywhere. I came away feeling like I'd just had a spiritual experience. Why died in reeling? I felt like I'd seen the future of basketball. Front offices around the NBA likely felt the same way. That's because the man they call Wimpy is the latest entry in a truly rare bloodline of player. So few times has something like this happened in the history of basketball. Kareem in 1969, a keen in 1984, Shaq in 1992, Tim Duncan in 1997, LeBron and O3. These were prospects that were so special, so obviously context and culture shifting, and so clearly on a path to transcendent superstardom that it's difficult to know just how far teams will be willing to go, or how much they'll be willing to sabotage their seasons in order to have a chance to land his services. There'll be plenty of time to fully evaluate Victor Winmanyama as we get closer to the draft, but before we do, I think that we should set out to answer some basic questions. Who is this guy? And what exactly is it about him that has fans and executives alike droning on and on? Is any of this real, or is he simply a novelty who had a big game at the right time? Victor Winmanyama was born on January 4th, 2004 and hails from La Shanae, France, a suburb just west of Paris. Although he just hit the mainstream vick is not a recent revelation, his pro career started with Nuttera 92 in 2019 when he was only 15 years old. One year before a clip of him playing two on two with fellow Frenchman Rudy Goberr went viral and caused the basketball world to look at their phones like Jimmy Dolan in the air up there. From Nuttera 92 he joined as Vell Villaban, a Euro League team owned by another legendary friend Cooper and Tony Parker, and in the fall of 2022 he decided to play for Metropolitan's 92. Victor's physical measurements are visibly extraterrestrial, but the details are hazy. In early September it was tweeted that Vic had measured 7 foot 4 in bare feet with an 8 foot wingspan, both absolutely shocking numbers. Vic however recently clarified that he has measured at 7 foot 3 in bare feet. You need only your eyes to understand that Wimbin Yama is fantastically long and taller than nearly anyone currently in the NBA. In every game that he is a part of, there's a freeze frame that almost feels like it's in the uncanny valley. He's thin, but with promising broad shoulders and a gate that is very much uncommon for such a frame. Vic is guarded about his influences as a player, but his ambitions are strong. If any person could say this and have it not be comedy, if anyone were capable of truly becoming something that we cannot comprehend, it's Victor Linman Yama. Among active players the comparisons are difficult. There are currently 5 players in the NBA who stay in 7 foot 2 or taller. The beloved Boba Marjana-Bitch, Bulbol, Christap's for Zingas, Luke Cornet, and Moses Brown. Only Boba who is much slower, stiffer, and far less flexible is comparably as tall and long. For Zingas and Cornet, also significantly inferior athletes are similar as shooters and only Bulb and Brown are similar in agility. None of them wrap the entire package into one like Wimbin Yama and that's not to mention that his feel for the game and competitiveness are a level above any of those players. This rarity forces us to rummage across eras. Only a handful of players in history have had a remotely similar convergence of gifts, and because Vic is growing up impacted by a world where the ball handling and shooting revolutions have already taken place, the skill comparisons are harder to make. Yao Ming, Arvita Sabonis, and Rick Smith's. Rick Smith's was really good and doesn't get enough credit. These were all giant human beings with polished ball skills, all things considered, but again, none of them were as mobile or defensively impactful as Wimbin Yama projects to beat. Many have agreed that watching Vic gracefully move among his peers stirs up visions of cream-abdule debars early days of power memorial in New York City. But even Ralph Sampson, a common comp who was listed at 7'4, was likely not as long or as tall. Some have expressed skepticism about Sampson's true size. Are you bigger than Sampson? Yeah, yeah. He's, I'd say, in the name of the 7'1, Rich Kelly's almost as tall as he is. Personally, I think a huge separating trait for Victor is his touch. To have arms as wide as a leer jet and hands the size of booky boards, he exhibits terrific touch when shooting and even passing the ball. Because of his size and lean frame, much of Vic's offensive life is facing up to the basket at this point. He demonstrated on a few occasions that he can attack the clothes out and finish with some creativity, and he's very quick and aggressive on the offensive glass. But the most impressive recent development in his game has been the ease with which he's getting to his jump shot. If he was simply catching and shooting at that size, great, his release point is incredibly high. But the flashes of versatility have been remarkable. Even more encouraging when we hear that he's been working with Holger Geshwinder, Dirk Novetzky's lifelong shooting coach, and by extension the man whose teachings had a profound influence on Kevin Durant. A wise move for someone who seems to prefer ripped through jumpers in the mid-range and off the bounce bumps that lead to fade away. That said, this is something to keep an eye on. Vic is still streaky and inconsistent as a shooter which makes his spectacular outburst in Las Vegas where he went 9 for 18 from 3, a little trickier to contextualize. The circumstances surrounding the shots are certainly a factor, but in the two biggest sustained shooting samples of his young career, he's returned varying results. 18 games during the 2020-21 season when he shot a satisfying 36.4% in 20 games during the 2021-22 season when he shot a less-than-stellar 26%. Approaching the rim, Wimpy has an absurd catch radius as a vertical spacer, as you to imagine. His rare flexibility is visible when he takes contact around the rim and is able to not only take a bump but improvise in the air, extend and still finish with touch. To be clear, this is not normal for a player who is 7'4\", because of his slight abilities most frequently popping out of ball screens looking for a jumper or trying to surprise the defense by slipping to the basket. He is also capable of making quick passing reads, I love this touch pass to a teammate under the rim, but it wouldn't categorize him as a manipulative pass or particularly creative. If that weren't enough, optimistic projections are that win-man-yama could become one of the more unique defensive anchors that we have ever seen. It could be the result of playing soccer as a goalie growing up, but in sheer size and feel for the game, he is perpetually disruptive. In ball screen coverages, he's quick and mobile enough and his lower body to switch on the smaller players in open space in more than hold his own, and he's long enough to drop or softly show and deter both pull up shooters and potential lob threats. He can test and erase his shots well with either hand, sometimes within the same play. Watch him cause two would be shooters in one sequence to think otherwise and then simply wall up to eradicate this challenge or the rim. Look, we're only scratching the surface, but here's the bottom line. When you add the filters of being 7'4' taller with a wingspan of at least 7'10, exceptional lateral agility and athletic elasticity, touch and creativity as a shooter and a self-creation score, high level impact as a defensive anchor that could reach defensive player of the year status, not to mention the poise and competitive instincts that he shows on both sides of the ball. Once you've added all of those filters, you've filtered out more or less every basketball player who's ever lived. Now does this mean that Vik will certainly become the best player who ever lived? No, does it even mean that he'll continue to get better? No, does it mean that he will avoid injuries that plague the special big guys that precede him? Again, no, it does not. The word prospect is defined as an apparent probability of success. For Victor Winmanyama with the unshakable confidence that he's shown off the court and the utter dominance that he's enjoyed on it, that probability of success is very much apparent. To quote one of my favorite bands, it's real. That's what we're all so excited about and that's what we're all hoping that we'll get to see. Let me know if you agree.",

        "text": "Did you start listening to L'Omar del Rey in seventh grade or are you normal? Hey guys, it's Amanda. I'm so welcome to my lovely floor. Today I'm gonna be talking about something that literally no one asked for but it's slightly interesting to me, so I guess I'm gonna talk about it, but maybe I really just sort of written this in my notebook and like went along with my thing and not made a whole YouTube video about it. I don't know about you guys, but this summer with kind of all the free time I've had lately, I have noticed how addicted I am to like screens. Like my phone, my laptop, social media, and general, the constant need to always be listening to something. Here are my AirPods. Like I'm just addicted to consuming content and it's it's scary because I'm aware of it, but at the same time I don't do anything to stop it. So yeah, I'm just gonna be talking about what it's like to be raised on the internet as a Gen Z or any way. I'm just gonna talk about some things I've noticed about myself as a result of being raised by the internet. And if you relate to any of these things, please let me know so I don't think that I'm like crazy and I'll never have a life outside of looking at a screen all day. Okay, so the first thing I'm gonna talk about is music, which might seem like out of nowhere, but music is really what like got me into the internet, I guess you could say, starting with my one direction stand phase in seventh grade. What a fateful day when I found out what one direction was, and that I learned about like the whole fandom and Twitter and all of that stuff. That like there was two directions my life could have gone in it went the one direction way. Okay, yeah, as a one direction stand, I feel like the heart of the community was really on Twitter and on Wattpad, which I'll get into that because literally my first friend in middle school, like we became friends because we bonded over reading the same one direction fan fiction. If that doesn't tell you about the course of my life, I don't know what does. First of all, it's this day. So I don't want to claim that one direction Twitter was like the nexus of stand Twitter, but it was really my introduction to stand Twitter. And the most defining characteristic about stand Twitter above anything else is just the sheer investment and dedication that people have. I noticed that like being on one direction stand Twitter, I was always constantly being updated with like what they were doing. And I'm not going to talk about one direction this whole video, okay? I promise like, but I feel like being a part of that community on Twitter, it like really started to consume my actual real life starting in middle school. I noticed that if I wasn't in class or if I wasn't like playing a sport or like doing homework, like nine out of ten times, I was on my phone scrolling through some type of social media app. The reason why I said that Lana Del Rey thing at the beginning is because Lana Del Rey, I think she actually led me to like start listening to like a whole indie genre. And that kind of like led me to like tumblr and that part of the internet. And that was also very influential in like seeing all these like aesthetics skinny girls in American apparel and like seeing Lana Del Rey smoke cigarettes with her red lipstick and that place ideas in my mind of like what beauty was and what I should aspire to be. Also, I remember in eighth grade I began to stand Lord so I had a word Instagram account and a word Twitter account. And this was at the time when Lord was like really small. I think it was probably around 2016 like royals had just came out so she was just getting her start. So it was a really small like a fandom community. And I literally remember thinking to myself like I have more friends on the internet than in real life. Like I probably had like three or four friends in real life, which I honestly like I didn't really care because I was like having so much fun on the internet. I was like who cares? I have my cold friends from like all over the world on Twitter. Also, I always attributed my left of like not many real life friends and honestly not really caring that I didn't have that many real life friends to being an introvert. But I realized that there was a disconnect between me saying I was an introvert and what being an introvert actually meant and what I would do in my time alone as an introvert if that makes sense. Like being an introvert just basically means that you get your energy from being alone. So you like to spend time alone after you know being out in the world of the day. At the same time even though I claim to be an introvert and that I like spending time alone. 99% of the time when I'm alone I'm never actually alone. I'm not alone with my thoughts. I'm alone with my phone and my laptop and Netflix and some type of entertainment constantly going. So basically at least for me the definition of introvert has shifted from being someone who likes to be alone as an alone with yourself and alone with your thoughts to someone who just likes to be physically alone. When I say that out loud like that's so bad. Like I'm like never really alone with my own thoughts because I get like bored of them. Like isn't that terrifying? Like you can't even spend time with the one person, the one brain that you will literally have to be in for your whole life. Why do I? Oh my gosh. That's scary. I'm really not trying to demonize technology. I'm just like really more so trying to examine my relationship with it and hopefully improve it a little. The primary influence though is on my attention span or lack thereof. I always joke about this but I quite literally have the attention span of a goldfish. Gen Z literally has an attention span on average of eight seconds which is why when you think about it it makes sense that an app where you could only upload six second or less videos has such a defining impact on our generation. I don't know what yum! You better stop stop stop! Human brains are plastic and they literally adapt and change over time. Like the paths, the neurons like go on. They just adapt to how we live and our brains have really changed because of our internet usage which is like crazy. Like I think it's cool and interesting and just a little bit scary because no one really knows what the implications are of having a whole generation whose brain has been shaped by the internet. I always think that my constant need for stimulation from my iPhone is like really going to inhibit me because there isn't really any precedent for successful people who grew up so attached to their screens in the way that I have which brings me to the next point which is self awareness. I feel like being on the internet a lot gives you a very heightened sense of self awareness because you're constantly looking at other people documenting themselves and perceiving them and then you're documenting yourself and trying to think of how you want to be perceived by other people. So you're just like very hyper aware of like who you are and how you're being presented to the world. Then I feel like it kind of manifests beyond the screen and into real life especially when I was like in middle school and high school. I really had this serious case of everyone's looking at me syndrome when of course in reality no one gave a fuck about what I was doing but I literally would not do simple things like I would be scared to like get a tissue or go to the bathroom in class or like throw away my lunch tray after like eating in the cafeteria because I was like oh my gosh if I stand up everyone's gonna look at me like they're all getting teeny walk to the garbage can at the reality that's so embarrassing. Cut the cameras. Dead at. Hopefully that's not just a main thing or also sounds like kind of crazy but the next thing I want to talk about when it comes to being raised by the internet is humor you know I think the gen C humor can be encapsulated in memes and I think the medium of our humor is really important to make note of like our humor is super visual it's all about pictures and videos it's just like super different from I don't know kids who grew up in like what the 1950s or something and like their humor they got from like listening to like a comedy set on a radio I don't know is that how it was back then I guess they have cartoons I think they think like memes are kind of like a vouch cartoons maybe a little bit which bring me to Facebook so Facebook is really not like the gen C platform like a lot of us are still on it or I would say more practical reasons than anything to like join Facebook groups not like really to like social network with the kids but it's funny because like stuff on a Facebook that are uncles and a grandparent's posts like completely like seriously or like even because they think it's funny like when we see it we're like that's really fucking funny because it's just like so absurd and like not funny that it's just like the pinnacle of irony to us so like we find it really funny also of course I can't talk about gen C humor without mentioning TikTok I feel like it's become a very integral medium of our sense of humor because basically you can just like use all the different audios to create to like personalize your own kind of you know comedic experience like basically we're just able to make like one thing really funny from a lot of different perspectives which is really cool and interesting like I'm not really sure like template memes started with gen C but that's essentially what TikTok is like in video form I've noticed that when it comes to virality and gen C it's shifted away from just like reposting and sharing an image or video and where you're always kind of finding a way to like insert our own comedy into a narrative to like add on a new perspective gen C humor is just a really interesting intersection of specificity universality and virality and it works I think it works hopefully this is entertaining somehow I just like maybe I just should have kept this to myself but if you're watching this thank you yeah comment your thoughts below and bye can we just take a moment of appreciation for this outfit because like what the oh my gosh this is actually terrifying",

        "text": "do you struggle to put together outfits in the morning do you browse pinterest for outfit inspo for hours but ultimately keep wearing the same three shirts over and over again do you find yourself lying in a giant pile of clothes flailing about like a beached whale well no longer in today's video we've got it all outfits for learning yearning flirting certain working and twerking am i right ladies you can get it all for the low low price of the past four days that i've worked on this video non-stop so please just enjoy this video guys oh god i figured what better way to start this video than with a combination everybody already owns jeans and a t-shirt this is my go-to when i feel like i have nothing to wear but here are some ways to make it look less like i rolled out of bed and more like i rolled out of a fashion magazine wow there's a [ __ ] smooth transition actually killing it first i'm tucking my t-shirt in all the way around to add some shape and then stretching it out so it looks a bit more relaxed i'm also rolling out the hem of my jeans to reveal some of that sexy sexy ankle action and since this outfit is so plain i'm going ham with accessories with these blingerific earrings and a red lip which i honestly never bothered to wear but whatever i do like damn i gotta do this more because i feel like a proper fancy adult lady i added some shoes with a pearl detail to match the pearls on my earrings but any kind of funky shoes would work for this outfit and there you have it and not so basic jeans and a t-shirt you can never go wrong with a graphic tee and some converse but if you've worn that outfit to death like i sure as hell have try switching out the jeans for a black wash and adding some matching black accessories for a more styled city chic look oh boy that is a tongue twister [Music] okay so i've seen a ton of 15 year olds on instagram who are cooler than i'll ever be layering a turtleneck under a graphic t-shirt but honestly i have no idea how the [ __ ] to do that without looking like a target employee during the holidays so my go-to is to layer them under summery dresses instead pairing a black turtleneck with black shoes is a really easy way to look color coordinated without trying too hard [Music] if your dress has one of those wide or plunging necklines that looks super cute but then takes a team of [ __ ] engineering students to figure out what type of bra would work underneath without showing the straps layering a turtleneck is a great option because it allows you to wear whatever regular comfy t-shirt bra you want and still have that super cute neckline if you want to get a little funky you can mix a striped turtleneck with a printed dress i honestly thought this outfit might make me look like a five-year-old but i look like a damn good five-year-old if i nope okay i shouldn't say that um it turned out to be one of my favorites in this entire video [Music] if it's still freezing where you live try layering a turtleneck under a crewneck sweater i think it looks adorable adds some warmth and prevents your kidneys from freezing off when you raise your arms or if your school has a strict dress code and you want to wear a crop top this is a great way to keep the boys focused on their schoolwork because god knows they couldn't do it with a rogue midriff out and about my next tip is to make the most of your dresses yes you may have worn every single shirt in your closet twice this week but have you tried wearing your dress as a shirt oh ho ho ho ho ho i bet you have not you guys always ask how i tuck this much fabric into my jeans and the key is to start with a short bodycon dress so there's less fabric to tuck in and to tuck it into a thick pair of jeans that will hide all those lumps and wrinkles none of that flimsy jegging [ __ ] okay and when you're smoothing it out really get down there caress the butt if it looks acceptable to do in public you are not doing it right honey add some sneakers and wham bam yes ma'am you got yourself a casual outfit with a brand new shirt if you don't feel like re-tucking your dress every time you pee or you just don't like the feeling of three layers of fabric around your crotch here is another option turn your wrap dress into a peplum top by folding the skirt portion underneath the waistline i ended up tucking the fabric into my bra to secure it but you can also use a waist belt or safety pins for extra hold and there you go a brand new peplum top [Music] of course you can wear your dress as a skirt too which i honestly prefer because it's a bit less finicky than this whole top situation try layering a t-shirt over a thin tank dress and tying it in the front with an elastic to create a little crop top or layer your t-shirt underneath to let the dress stand out um i'm not really sure what point i'm trying to illustrate with this outfit but i kind of got carried away at this point and i think it's a really cute option if your dress has some bulkier detail around the top like this one pop on a thick sweater to hide all those lumps and bumps my humps my humps my lovely lady lumps by the way that's a really weird song if you think about it even if you don't think about it it's a weird song that's an issue for another time um if you don't have a cropped sweater here's a way to cinch in your waistline i'm getting real creative in this video guys grab a belt that fits around your waistline put it over the sweater and then shimmy the sweater upwards until it hides the belt so it just looks like a cropped sweater if your dress has a plunging neckline try layering a collared shirt underneath for a bit of a cute and conservative look and finally if those weren't enough options for you you can even wear your wrap dress as outerwear just leave it completely undone for a kind of shawl cardigan situation next on the agenda layering socks under heels and sneakers some people think this looks hideous some people think it looks cute clearly i fall into the ladder category i got these crew socks for like two dollars on amazon and they are the perfect affordable way to spice up your outfits make summer sandals look more winter appropriate add an extra pop of color or just make yourself look like a blues clues character they even work with casual jeans and sneakers just make sure to cuff your jeans to show off your socks in proper 90s fashion if you're really running low on clothes to wear try stealing oversized pieces from your boyfriend brother or the next tinder hookup who calls you exotic i tied this short sleeve button up around my waist to turn it into a crop top layered a turtleneck underneath and now i look ready to tell you that it's not just a phase mom you can find an oversized button-up like this in pretty much any thrift store to make it look less risky business and more of an outfit i'm cinching in the waist with a statement belt and adding some black accessories to tie everything together to wear it as a blouse without looking too corporate i'm unbuttoning the shirt and pushing it back on my shoulders to create this wide almost off the shoulder neckline and cuffing the sleeves now admittedly i kind of look like a schoolteacher but at least i look like the cool school teacher that you have a crush on to style an oversized men's jacket cough the sleeves and wear it slightly off the shoulder this works particularly well with a soft less structured fabric so it drapes off your body rather than looking like too chunky and weird around the shoulders if you don't have any boys in your life to steal from try repurposing your grandma's silk scarf or more accurately one from a stranger's grandma that i got from a goodwill outlet oh god i'm wearing dead people clothing aren't i anyways to turn this into a top wrap it around your boobs twist it in the back and secure a knot in the front this is surprisingly secure i honestly could do some good bouncing in this top but i'm not gonna give that one to our resonant channel pervs but if you need to you can tuck the edges of the scarf into your strapless bra for some added security swapping out the sandals for boots here's a warmer version that doesn't let the top shine as much but it's still a good option for those days when all your t-shirts are dirty but you still have three pairs of underwear left so you refuse to do the laundry out of pride not speaking from personal experience or anything i know what you're thinking ashley i'm not a [ __ ] power ranger how am i supposed to casually have a suit of entirely one color i will say monochrome looks are easier to pull together than you might expect and instantly make you look like you put an honestly intimidating amount of effort into your outfit obviously the easiest way is to go for an all-white or all-black outfit but even if you are putting together a colorful outfit really the shades don't have to match exactly like here i have three very different shades of tan but it still overall reads as monochrome and honestly i think it's a bit better if the shades are different so it adds some dimension to your outfit here are some other tips for putting together monochrome outfits try mixing up the textures like here i have both leather and denim add some accessories to add detail and don't be afraid to add a little pop of a contrasting color like the text on this t-shirt on the opposite end of the spectrum there has never been a better time to get wild with some pattern mixing does this look cool or do i look like i'm a christmas elf addicted to hot topic i don't know but there's bound to be some niche on instagram who's into that personally though i do think it works especially because the black in the leopard print and the floral print and the black of my jeans and shoes ties the whole outfit together i think that's the key with pattern mixing you really want to have at least one common color between all of your prints denim on denim used to make me want to [ __ ] tear my eyeballs out but somewhere in the past year i have given in to the dark wash side but um if you don't want an outfit that screams canadian tuxedo and try mixing a light and dark wash to break out the look alternatively here is an outfit with similar washes but i think it works because the sherpa lining on my jacket and my exposed legoronies prevent me from looking too stuffy and all that denim i really didn't know what to call this section but basically here are some interesting outfit combinations to try most people reserve thigh high boots for short skirts and if you're ariana grande oversized hoodies but you can make them look a lot less dangerous woman with a midi skirt since you can't see the end of the boots i think it looks quite chic and ladylike this combination has been my go-to lately which is juxtaposing a girly mini dress with chunky platform shoes or boots with some type of hardware on them i just think it looks really cool and casual and it's such a foolproof combination next up you could try a menswear inspired look with an oversized blazer a turtleneck and some loafers sometimes i feel like it's intimidating to put that many menswear inspired pieces together but as long as you have well-fitting jeans and an exposed ankle you won't get too lost in fabric and i think it looks very oxford chic and finally try layering a chunky sweater over a skirt and leaving it untucked for a drop waist silhouette i chronically tuck in my shirts and sweaters so this look is kind of new for me but i think it's quite cute and let me tell you it is fantastic for hiding a food baby too just make sure to wear shoes with a little bit of height to balance out the chunkier silhouette you guys know i am no stranger to showing off some scandalous shoulders and ambiguous upper thigh ass territory but some dresses are a little bit too sexual even for me so here's how you turn a nighttime lingerie look into a daytime outfit first i'm layering a t-shirt underneath to cover up the old bobberonies and creating a cute layered look and then i'm tucking my dress into some loose military inspired pants for a masculine meets feminine look for this next look i'm layering an oversized blazer on top to balance out how short and tight the skirt is popping on some flat loafers i really didn't want anything with a heel because i already have so much leg out and voila now i have a sexy hermione halloween costume i have also been loving the corset bodice trend lately i layered a turtleneck under this sheer bodysuit for some extra coverage and paired it with a checkered skirt for some subtle pattern mixing and here is an edgier option with that same bodice i don't know i just love the layered look and i think corsets are a great way to add a pop of color and texture to an otherwise pretty plain outfit [Music] i don't know if this is like too simple to put in this video but another tip is to play around with the necklines on tops that you already have so if you have a wide neck top like this try moving the sleeves off the shoulder for a more feminine dainty off-the-shoulder look and if you live through 2016 you probably have a top that looks something like this if you've worn the off-the-shoulder look to death you can shimmy up the sleeve nubbins to create this kind of scoop neck t-shirt with an exposed back and this is the final tip of this video thank god because i need a [ __ ] glass of water after narrating all of this if you have a plain dress that you've worn the heck out of try changing it up with some statement belts or scarves this is like a random gingham piece of fabric that came with a shirt that i thrifted or you could even use a scrap of fabric from a craft store for this i'm just tying it around my waist as one does here is a little no-sew hack for you guys if your dress is a bit long tuck in some of the extra fabric around your waist and if your sash is large enough it should hide any wrinkles quite well and there we go now my basic dress is picnic [ __ ] approved here's another option with that dead grandma scarf from earlier i'm leaving it quite thick to create a kind of pseudo corset look and pairing it with these suede boots and now i'm ready to uh woo some boys at the county fair you guys have seen this belt before but it's literally the best 15 i've ever spent it completely changes up a dress and i love the juxtaposition between this beachy white dress and some black hardware and those are all 50 outfits this is my first video that i'm filming in my new apartment and goddamn i'm so excited to have enough space to film these outfit videos without like rearranging my whole bedroom so look forward to many more fashion videos to come otherwise thank you so much for watching and i will see you guys next week hi hey guys it's ashley here to talk why am i waiting for the camera for that hey guys",

        "description": "You're a part of mixed martial arts.",
        "text": "You're a part of mixed martial arts. It's people that move in interesting ways. Move well in interesting ways. I was thinking, you know who Lionel Messi is being sure? So the soccer player, he's my favorite. Talking about things that divide the populace with the vaccines is probably Messi versus Christiano Ronaldo, who's the greatest player of all time, or currently playing that divides people too. But what is the division? They're just both incredible. But what is it like who's better LeBron or Michael Jordan? Is it like that kind of thing? People get very passionate about that. They extremely passionate. Who do you think is better? Messi by far. How can you? How can you? I'm far by far. So what I was so sometimes, well, so it has to do with movement. So it has to do with where you put priorities. So the other people in the running for greatest ever, I don't even think we're not all those in the top five, but is Maradona, Pellet. So more shots fired moment right here? Did you shot was? Was that not fired? That was, yeah. I'm not allowed to loop when it comes to soccer, but I think you just made something. I think the Brazilian resistance. Yeah, I think the Brazilian resistance or no, those better than Christiano. But so Christiano is much better looking. He's much harder working. He's an incredible soccer player. One of the greatest ever, just not in the top five for me. Messi moves like nothing I have ever seen. And this is like a lot of people agree that there's moments of genius unlike anybody else. This everybody agrees on. And the question is, how much do you value moments of genius in terms of movement? Just like how many things you're able to create, they're like, what the fuck did I just want? Right. That I value that above all else. Now one of the reasons why until like a month ago, people still said Messi might not be the greatest ever is because he's never taken his national team, Argentina, to a major, like a World Cup win, or the Copo America, or like the major international win. He's always, he's taken him to the final a bunch of times, but never won. And so that has to, that's like LeBron questions. How many times if ever did you take your team, especially when the team is not great, did you make them step up to win the championship? Right. And until this, so he won the South American championship, which is a huge championship for the first time with Argentina last month, which solidified them is the greatest. Anyway, I'm making some enemies now. But the main point is the movement, I think I want to agree, he is in, like when you watch him, it's art. And I was thinking in the same way, who is that? Like if you didn't see the face or the uniform, if you just saw the silhouette, you could tell it's Messi. And I was thinking who is that for MMA? Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse is the greatest I've ever seen. So I was thinking Anderson Silva. Nah, well Anderson Silva was fantastic, and it's prime, no doubt about it. But Mighty Mouse, the problem, the only problem with Mighty Mouse is that he's in a weight class that's very small. There's not a lot of guys that weigh 125 pounds, so there's not the same talent pool that Anderson Silva dealt with. Anderson Silva dealt with much more danger in terms of one punch strikers. But the argument could be made that Anderson Silva when he was at the top is the greatest of all time. And then the argument could be made that Mighty Mouse is the greatest of all time. Mighty Mouse just destroyed people.",

        "text": "netflix has done a 10 billion in debt there's no way they can make money shares are down about eight percent so far this year they're not going to be able to keep up it's not completely clear how this is going to evolve netflix surging to a brand new all-time high today squid game is the most watched netflix show ever it went number one in over 90 countries it's my vlog with games it's really become a global phenomenon these guys have the globe kind of to themselves it literally changed the trajectory of netflix business and drove their stock to a record high in just three weeks the instagram following of one of the main actors rose from 400 000 to over 16 million and white van sales spiked 7 800 percent damn daniel that's crazy seems like a lot to me yeah now fair warning this episode is going to have a lot of spoilers like the fact that it seems a little aggressive to open with a spoiler yeah okay now is your fair warning to go watch all of squid game if you don't want it to be spoiled in this episode we're going to break down our thoughts on squid game why it's so successful and what creators can learn from it we're also gonna play our own game in this episode one of the games that was actually featured on the show we are gonna play here this is news to me same consequences as squid game all right colin roll the intro [Music] this show was at least the first time that i experienced a netflix show like this taking over the global conversation i mean i think it's the first time netflix has experienced it 100 so it's an extremely global show for a number of reasons the first being that it was released subtitled in 31 languages and dubbed in 13 on the exact same day netflix alone is available in 190 countries so it has the ability to reach a massive audience from day one the story itself had so much global appeal i think there's so much to be learned from how squid game was structured from a story perspective like this show and the narratives in it and the tropes in it just globally appealing it's a show about a bunch of people who are in debt in south korea and they get invited to a place to play a series of games where the winner at the end of all these games will win an amount of money that is so large that it would solve all their money problems and these are children's games they're going to play six games while they're there but if you lose a game you die so the stakes are incredibly high and it is done in a way that i think just captivated a global audience to a scale that we've never seen before to start it was extremely simple from the locations to the outfits everything was the most simple version i think what happens when you fix all of those elements and make them really simple the story gets easier to follow the players where this color the scary triangle men and square men and circlemen the soldiers where this color the front man wears this color like it was very clear-cut i think not only does the story get easier to follow but when everything is that simple when the games are that simple right the first game they play is red light green light green light red light everyone knows that game all over the world and if you don't know it you can understand it you run when it's green light you stop when it's red light so that ability to put yourself in the position of the character no matter where you are in the world that relatability keeps you more engaged at least i found that when i was watching i was like wait would i be able to stop quick enough to not get shot you know like you're thinking that in your head like how would i act in this game and i think that's a really important thing for anyone who's telling a story basically thinking about like how relatable is this could you even if this is a fantasy right even if this is a fictional world can you put yourself in the position of this character okay ready for game one sure colin and i each have ten marbles in our hands basically one of us is gonna put a certain amount in our hands and the other person has to guess if it's odd number of marbles or an even number and when you guess you wager a certain amount of marble so you could wager five marbles so if you guess it right you win five marbles from me your goal is to take as many marbles for me as possible we're gonna play this game three times during this recording okay now what you don't know is that by the end of the episode the person with the least number of marbles will have to eat something disgusting chosen by chris i'm chris it's my job to go to the store and find something horrible for the loser to eat odds are evens odd what do you have damn one thing i saw and i sent to everyone on our team was this meme where the front man was mr beast's voice i bought this entire island i brought in a bunch of my subscribers and gave them a chance to win tons of money i thought it was so funny and that's actually what pulled me into watching the show i was like this clearly relates to our world too and for someone to be able to draw such a parallel between what mr beast is doing and what's happening in this netflix show i thought that was really interesting the numbers that netflix released about their viewership like bridgerton had done 82 million views in the first 28 days it's interesting is like jimmy is competing on that level a lot of times like a lot of his episodes have 100 million views it's one of the most successful formats in all of entertainment you think about the price is right yeah the longest running show on television mr beast the number one channel right on youtube hunger games one of the most epic movie franchises money is a very universal stake that resonates all over the world in every different culture like we all are sort of beholden to the system that relies on money the two things that this show hinges on are money and death those two things are universally understandable we all when we're alive are playing by the rules of money and it's this game that we all understand like it is literally and figuratively hanging over our heads at all times yes and so that is so universally understandable like if you talk to anyone in any other country and you talk about making money you get it what else is it that makes this so appealing to watch and so engaging and what jimmy talks about a lot is retention and i think what squid game did really well was utilize some retention strategies that were just so good at building up tension in our bodies and then releasing that tension one tactic that squid game used very well was jenga storytelling so this is the idea that tension should rise over time and i think they did a really good job of building tension that continues to rise from episode one all the way until the finale there's more money up for grabs the further the series goes along and the more people that die so the stakes are rising and another tension point is pain the more time that goes on the more painful it will be for one of the players to lose right because they've already invested so much time and not only have they invested time but you're learning more about them like um i might butcher some of the yeah names here saibik she's like the main character she's one of the last three but you learned that she wants the money to save her little brother who's an orphan and needs like a family and you're like oh my god my stakes just increased gyoung is like this deadbeat you know character who's always just wanted validation and wants a connection to his mom and wants a connection to his daughter like as time goes on that state gets crazy high because you're like god i want this guy to have some money but what's interesting is that him winning money comes at the cost of someone losing their life or actually 400 some odd people losing their lives so it's a very complex emotion to feel the action of having to negotiate that in your mind as these stakes rise builds a lot of tension even when gyeong is playing marbles with the old man he's tricking him and you're not sure what you're supposed to feel it's a complex emotion of do i am i happy that he's gonna be okay and win because he's our main character or am i like really upset with him for tricking this guy like i think that increase of stakes as well as this release of tension that is emotionally like a roller coaster where sometimes you're happy sometimes you're sad sometimes you're confused that makes you so engaged in the show yeah you want to release tension at disproportionate levels because you want everyone on the edge of their seat totally unaware of what's going to happen next and a great way to do this is to introduce new narratives to the story and squid game did this really well you have a scenario where everyone shows up they think they're playing this game for money everyone here will participate in six different games over six days those who win all six games will receive a handsome cash prize they find out they're playing this game not only for money but also for their life [Applause] and we think okay the only way you die is if you play the game and you get out still terrible but those are the rules then we learn when someone gets murdered that that's another way to lose the game player 271 eliminated that was wild because that introduction of that rule creates tons of mayhem and again in the viewer's mind you're like whoa you figured that out along with the people in the show and that i think is really compelling they completely flip the switch and that's really powerful from a retention standpoint when it comes to storytelling mr beast does these narrative changes all the time where it's like okay you think that as long as you stay in this circle you win what you don't know is the circle's getting smaller and what you don't know is then you're gonna have to stand on one foot and then what you don't know is that you know and like all of a sudden it's like well you didn't know it you didn't know what you didn't know so what we're talking about here is keeping viewers on their toes by adding in new narratives let's say you're not a creator who's making a game show if you're a cooking channel how would you potentially work that into your story let's say you're doing a how-to what would be a secondary narrative try guys i think are a great example where like try guys cook without a recipe that's a great format to introduce unexpected things happening where like the audience knows the recipe or the audience knows how to make it they don't know they have to solve it they're going to throw in different ideas in the middle there's all the characters like creating a dynamic where narrative changes can happen just because the characters are in that flow i think works really well like just creating situations for viewers to be creating situations where there's room for what's not planned i think travel vlogs have so much room for the unplanned to make the videos great and also for even if you do have a show like you and i where like one of us doesn't know something or in this setting on this show both of us don't know something but the audience i think both of us don't know something you know has this all been orchestrated am i meant to lose is this what's happening [Music] [Laughter] this could be good oh that's good this might be it all right nerve-wracking let's play again again okay hold on i don't know what i did with my marbles colin's lost his marbles no i've got him even what is it is it odd that's a big wager oh man there's only one more game left oh that sucks i i really thought i was gonna get you on that oh six is tough yes all right so let's talk about how how does squid game impact the future of how creators are going to operate the future of what we're going to see on youtube specifically squid game pushed me to think about what is possible with creators i've never seen anything dominate a conversation globally in such a short amount of time like squid game and have such a ridiculous impact on all types of economies i saw jimmy fallon doing licking a honeycomb to get the umbrella out right it's like and that has a lot to do right with the fact that netflix is in 190 countries that they have the infrastructure to put out a show in 34 different languages all at once but if you look at what's happening on youtube channels are starting to dub over and subtitle their videos yep unilingo the company that does mr beast does um veritasium i think starting to do marc rober as well they're all launching multiple channels and they're doing it pretty quickly so when that catches up does mr beast's video get translated in five different languages and get released on the same day in all those languages and does youtube actually slowly start to roll out like similar to how you can choose what resolution you're watching it in can you choose what language you're watching it now all of a sudden channels are going to become way more global again this is a global entertainment industry now the internet has changed that completely and you do have to make content that's global so how did you watch it did you watch it with subtitles or you watch it with english dub english dub oh man me too listen i can't die i need to get out of here we are totally in the minority and we're totally wrong and i went back and watched one of the episodes with the korean actors like their actual emotion yeah completely different there is a really good line from i think it's the creator of the show that said if viewers can get over the barrier of a one-inch subtitle text box the world of film will open up to them and i think that's really interesting that now we're starting to open up to more global content now we're starting to see it creep into you know the social media world with mr beast going into spanish all these other creators starting to explore dubbing but you really think about like the internet is a global place so it makes sense that the content would be globally accessible it's all about having the maximum potential audience setting yourself up for that level of success like there are certain topics that we could talk about on this show that we know don't have a huge audience buenos aires the other thing that i was really thinking about over the weekend when i finished squid game was that creators are gonna start to learn more from traditional media like there's stuff from hollywood's past and learnings that writers have been using for years and years and years that i think if you take the time to learn those things as a creator and study them you can apply them to your work yeah a great example of this is a video that we actually shared from the creators of south park we can take these beats which are basically the beats of your outline and if the words and then belong between those beats you're no no it should be this happens and therefore this happens but this happens therefore this happens you see movies you're just watching it's like this happened and then this happens and then this happens that's when you're in a movie just going what the am i watching this movie just like this happened and then this happened in this stop that's not a movie you know that's not a story like trey said it's those two but because therefore that is a really important skill to have as a content creator and i think these worlds are just starting to match from a storytelling perspective not from a production value perspective but from a storytelling perspective you have to compete you have to be telling a compelling story they are starting to follow similar business models though if you look at you know netflix is now selling squid game merchandise right with walmart and they're selling merch from some of their other franchises they are getting into gaming by hiring a head of gaming and people are saying squid games should have an actual video game that could be a reality for netflix so they are diversifying the ways that they make money beyond just direct-to-consumer revenue and that's something that i think creators have been doing for a long time i think the main thing they create and this is what all storytellers create is culture and i think what we're seeing with netflix is they are like a culture factory they can create culture all right i can't wait any longer let's play another round all or nothing i'm i'm betting all of my marbles it's all or nothing loser has to eat whatever chris picked up for us okay we've got our items we've got smoked oysters in sriracha chili sauce and just a whole bottle of clam juice good luck gentlemen all right this one's for all the marbles oh man i can't believe this is a 50 50 chance that i get this wrong oh man we don't got all day man squid game comes for everyone squid game waits for no one oh i don't want to eat it i don't want to eat it you don't even know everything i really don't want anything i have a feeling that it's something bad [Music] wow what a strange ending i didn't even know how many marbles i have all right give it to me oh oh this is gross oh my god look at the clams look at the clamps these stakes were too high if you guys were in my position which one would you which one would you do i would do the clam juice all right everyone cheers [Music] thanks for watching this episode of the call it's smear show let us know oh you gotta do this dude subscribe oh my god [Music] you",

talk a little bit about your background tell us a little bit about your family and where you're from and and uh you know kind of sure how you grew up uh so i grew up in ireland um i guess it was a pretty standard uh irish upbringing um i spent most of my life uh living in like this really rural part of ireland uh it was sort of surrounded by farms and fields and stuff yeah and i mean this was kind of problematic when so i remember we didn't get a computer for a long time and even we got a computer it took a long time before we got uh internet access and so i remember renting or borrowing books from the library that like read about the internet because we couldn't actually get the internet and so there's like a period of about two years when i was reading these amazing books about the international sound it's so futuristic uh and and then we got the internet but the the phone line didn't work very well and so i remember like going to you know these bandwidth test sites and i got like 0.5 k a second uh and so you know the workflow is like have a book with you while you use the internet because you go like read a page of your book you'd like look up see if the page is loaded and chances are it hadn't sure went back to the book um and then eventually for like the last i think three years we managed to get this satellite internet connection because that was basically the only way to connect this like really rural part of ireland to the internet um and and that finally worked well and that was like 512k broadband but um the latency was horrible because like packets had to go like out into space and back down to germany and so you have like some ssh session and like you know you press a key and like two seconds later it appears but but at least the bandwidth is good so um most most of my childhood was sort of i played with lego when i was really young and then i sort of jumped straight to computers and so most of my childhood was either miss spent on lego or computers yeah and when did you when did you start really using computers or programming um i picked up php i guess like like most of the world of teams um first uh and i started that when i was 13. okay yeah and uh tell me tell me a little bit about your parents uh lily dennis is that right that's right um what what were their professions what did they do and so uh my mom originally trained as a microbiologist um and and so i guess ireland is is or at least was at the time when i grew up sort of pretty traditional uh and so when i was i was the first child and so when i was born uh ireland being such a catholic country she was she was expected to leave her job and go raise her new kid and so she has this like wonderful letter from her employer at the time where it's you know congratulating her and her fine career and wishing her all the best you know raising her kid in the future before she'd like given any notice or anything like that just who it was assumed that you know she would leave um and so she did anyway i think in part because she was so pissed off by that letter um and and then so she i guess you know stayed at home with me and then i think it was like three weeks after i was born she started a company uh and so i guess i was just like i was that boring totally normal yeah the recovery period most mothers i think i think that this just speaks to how unstimulating i must have been as a baby um so so she she started this um this corporate training company uh and so basically like iso 9000 or six sigma or um or all this kind of stuff um and that company's still going today uh and and it's very much not a silicon valley startup um it's been profitable every year since it was founded and now i guess it's the same age as me so i suppose 23 years later i think it employs like 12 or 13 people wow and that's my mom um and dad dad trained as an electrical engineer and uh and both my parents again sort of very rural irish upbringing they grew up on farms dad was one of the first kids in the family to go to college uh he went to work for dell and then in ireland in ireland yeah and then he decided uh i think i was about five or so that he was going to go buy a hotel um on the shores of this lake in the middle of ireland which is how we ended up in this dire internet languishing situation that wasn't one of the upgraded features of the hotel i guess there was no internet access there yeah they came later it was great there was none of these like stupid paid twenty dollars a night for the wi-fi thing um it was just uh there was no internet and so you have you have two brothers um your brother john who works with you at strife who co-founded the company with you and your brother tommy what uh just talk about your relationship with with each other and are you are you very similar are you very different are you yeah so um so john and i are pretty close in age yeah uh we're two years apart john's two years younger um we were i guess we were similar-ish growing up um i i got more into programming um sort of through school and and john was more into sort of math and chess and stuff um but i guess we were both sort of pretty nerdy we both sort of read a lot and we were pretty competitive actually and so i think it was kind of helpful that um i eventually sort of went away to college in the us and you know spend some time away from home because i i think that sort of allowed us to to develop a part a little bit and then tommy uh is five years younger than john uh and uh he's the one who's actually going to be famous and wrong in several years and so i know maybe in 10 years time people i think he's already famous people will stumble across this interview because they're like googling tommy collins and makes this turn up or something and he's had more twitter followers than me since i think he was like 13 or something um so mostly it's just embarrassing so um you know you grew up in this home uh you know entrepreneurial home really and you're by your mid teens you you start to enter these science you know contests and things like that tell me how that started what with the motivation behind that and what happened tell us you know how you did um so so this mostly came out of well i guess two things one is uh this this kind of science competition was was very well known and um and fairly kind of prestigious within ireland and so just got a lot of media attention everything so uh it was it was fairly obvious that you sort of would would love to take part in it and uh and a lot of the winning projects that came out of it were actually very cool um a couple years like when i was in in primary school uh which i guess means age you know 10 00 or something like that um a project one that was a much faster version of rsa but some like fairly kind of significant um cryptography research and uh the girl who did that ended up you know going to work with stephen holt from the quote from research um and there were like a bunch of like pretty substantial mathematics breakthroughs you know new theorems um and and generally stuff that just like it doesn't it didn't seem sort of any way kind of um i think some of these competitions like for high school students and stuff have a tendency to seem kind of uh like condescending or junior or like you know you pat it on the head for like you know making your volcano model or something sure uh and there was no sense of that it sounds like one of the us ones so i i've never been to any of those but uh you were doing cryptography it's a word i can't really pronounce very well and we're doing the volcano yeah um we're screwed also uh i i was very taken with it anyway and so when uh when i got into programming uh fairly quickly i started wondering um if if i could do anything for this and after php i tried to learn java and i found i remember spending like a year trying to learn java and just finding it so miserable and i basically concluded that i just i should do something else and not uh and not be a programmer um but then i think it was from the i stumbled across python from some essay that somebody wrote and then when i was like reading the python mailing list or something um people were always referencing lists but as the inspiration for a lot of things in python like you know map and reducing whatever uh and so i went and i looked into lisp and lisp just seemed totally great um and so so i started writing this um i started trying to implement the msn messenger protocol msn messenger was basically the aim of europe and like all my friends were on msn messenger uh and actually the earlier versions of the msn messenger protocol were fairly straightforward so i started implementing this um and then sort of i finally got to the point where you can actually like send messages to people and and then and sort of the project sort of was just or like this little prototype thing was now a success but now i had to sort of figure out you know what messages the program should actually send uh and so you know that that actually starts becoming a pretty pretty interesting problem so like the really the first version just had like a you know it had a repertoire of sort of pre-programmed responses and just sort of picked those at random and then you realize that like not everyone sort of immediately realizes that they're taught into a program and they start to like engage it in conversation and so i gave it a name i called that isaac um and then started like writing these heuristics to try to have it you know keep the conversation going for as long as possible um and that just became this like really this totally fascinating thing and so one of the i'm sure a lot of you guys know that uh one of the um the sort of the big challenges in artificial intelligence has been the turing test where sort of you you have some human who's able to correspond you know through you know some some terminal with both another human and a computer program and the turing test proposed by alan turing suggests that you know true or in the case of true artificial intelligence one would not be able to discern you know which was the program which is excuse me yeah which was the program which is um the human um and and so now with uh with uh instant messaging basically you actually kind of i mean people didn't realize they were playing the tutoring test but you kind of had them playing the turing test and you're able to sort of implement this massively parallel turing test and so ended up writing these programs that sort of tried to learn from all the conversations that they were having and and sort of go as far as they could and so you know built up this like enormous database from hundreds of thousands of conversations and just basically went down that ai rabbit hole and so that's some work around that was what i first entered into this competition and that's that was like the first time that i really felt like i'd done something kind of remotely interesting in programming so so in 2006 you uh you apply to mit you you attend mit your first you attended your first semester and at the time you and your brother start this company tell us a little bit about that yes i went to mit um i played mit sort of when i still had a year and a half left in high school so i sort of ended up starting a year early um i actually came out to step i my first time ever in the us was i came to stanford for the international lisp conference in 2005. and i was just uh it was like this really eye-opening moment where like there is this other world of american universities basically um and so that was in like june or something and i decided basically then that i would just like apply to american schools you know for the next year which i guess was kind of outside the spec but i mean you know the worst that would happen is you know they'd reject you and you could supply the next year or something and so i did that and it worked out and so i started at mit um but i was kind of a year behind and i started when i was 17 and so i sort of felt like i just kind of had this spare year and the irish high school system is pretty bad in a lot of ways but uh one thing that's good about it is that you sort of do three years then this big exam and then you have this optional gap year before you do sort of two years and then another exam and that gap year is supposed to be a time when you can kind of explore other interests or you know just like do some work experience in a career that you think you might want to pursue or go travel the world or whatever it is and john my my younger brother was kind of currently in this year and so we both kind of had just lined up with some spare time and we decided that you know we might as well try to start a company because it seemed kind of interesting um and he was how old uh he was 16. okay um and so we started this company and the the basic idea was that um we we thought ebay was really cool and that sort of by providing kind of liquidity to to use items which is kind of and kind of exploiting that possibility for coordination it was sort of making the world much more efficient um and uh obviously ebay just sucks um i apologize to any ebay it's okay word aol we're not here yeah um uh i i mean i guess the more charitable way of saying something like you know ebay's rate of improvement had slowed by 2006. um for the americans in the room means it sucked so uh so we tried to build or we decided to build sort of some better version of ebay we didn't really want to eat um terribly clear ideas of how to go about that but we started working some prototypes um and then we applied to y combinator um and what actually ended up happening is we merged with uh uh the com another company started by two guys um harjin kovya tiger who um who had built a student marketplace in the uk and kind of basically also wanted to build a better version of ebay so the four of us uh came together in may of 2007 to to work on automatic and yeah the goal was to build a better rebate and how did that just tell us how that process came together was that something where after you because you applied to y combinator with this original idea and then was it something where paul is like hey yo you got to you got to meet these other guys how did it work he basically suggested that we talk to them and sort of figure out if there was any any ways in which we could work together and like pretty rapidly after meeting we decided it made sense to work together and they had sort of spent a long time working on this they had i mean they successfully launched this marketplace um and they we really felt that sort of they had a very good understanding of it and you know we we liked the idea of working with them they felt really good um and and actually now um haraj um is a partner at my company sure yeah and so you so you go through you went through you actually went to the y combinator program you guys moved here that's right we we moved out here um and we we got this like small little apartment in san francisco and yeah uh and and went to work basically um and and that was sort of really the that was my first time sort of spending a significant amount of time on the west coast and instead of learning how like startups worked and like really automatically just like this this incredibly sort of foreshortened introduction to like startup land there's like this whirlwind tour and that you know came out and sort of started working this product we raised some money from angel investors uh we launched the product um uh you know it did reasonably well and people liked it and then it was acquired and like all of that happened sort of uh from from incorporation to acquisition like 10 months and so octomatic never left sort of a huge park in the world but it was is it an incredible learning experience i mean you guys and and i mean it was big news because you were you and your brother were so young right and um i mean you you were all over the uk i mean there was just a ton of press did you did you feel you know how did it feel coming out of that did you feel like this how did it feel to be honest i always felt it was a little bit misplaced um in that uh i i mean there was a great sort of learning experience for us i don't think that automatic ever uh yeah it was a great learning experience but it never sort of left any huge mark on the world and so i don't know i've never been sort of all that enthusiastic with sort of it being interesting simply because we were so young i mean uh i don't know i i feel like they're we're sort of very lucky we're sort of circumstances aligned and like i've been out here and i sort of knew paul a little bit through lisp and stuff where we're sort of we managed to go through my combinator and sort of things worked out but i don't think we basically don't think we did anything all that special and so you saw this company you sell the company did you move to canada to actually be a part of the company yes so i moved and became the director of engineering for the aquarium company um and spent about a year in canada okay and um so you spend a year on camera your your brother goes back to school right he went back and he finished uh school in ireland and we're kind of lucky this kind of gets back to the competitive aspect in that uh i actually did this in order to graduate early to start college i did the the british sort of leaving school exam with the a levels and he did the irish ones and so we sort of never competed head-to-head which was kind of lucky for me because he ended up getting the uh the highest score in history in these exams wow this really sucks um so uh so you go through this next year you're working as director of engineering he goes to harvard right and then you are you guys are you're talking this whole time are you saying hey okay we're gonna you know what's the next thing what are we gonna do or where where is your head at that point you're you're not you're not gonna stay in canada forever i'm right i'm sure so right yeah we sort of yeah i mean obviously kind of kept in touch and everything and then um i decided to go back to mit because i sort of like i felt like this you know i was going to the end of this kind of one-year experiment right from from you know looking at what would be like to start a company uh and i guess neither of us were kind of sure that we didn't want to sort of go down the academic right like you should try to become professors or something um and uh and so i went back to mit john was at harvard um and uh and we just you know had some side projects going on the side i think the the one that was most um at least most fun to work on was um when the when the iphone came out there was um there was no sdk initially but uh i was walking down actually the street in vancouver with my friend we sort of realized that uh the the iphone was actually powerful enough and had enough storage space that you could store a complete copy of wikipedia on the iphone and so you could basically actually implement like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and uh and so i think it was uh december of 2007 um uh um my friend managed to get like a working kind of jailbroken iphone uh tool chain and so like this hacked version of like gcc that could you know cross-compile to arm on the iphone and he just like wrote some header files kind of guessing the method signatures of the the ui kit selectors uh and he sort of showed me at like 3am one morning you know like a working hello world app on the iphone and this was back when apple still maintained that you know there were only going to be web apps and only like the the um the apps that they're actually built internally at apple they were sort of the only native apps that would be allowed around the iphone um but so this friend who uh brian who now actually works with stripe uh he got this tool chain running and so we decided to like try to build this um this hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy app uh and this was just like a ton of time you know steering and arm disassembly and everything but but it finally worked and we released it and um and it was terrible because we hosted the wikipedia dumps ourselves and so it ended up getting like a ton of downloads and each one was two gigs and so there was basically like i was hosting it on slicehost and there was this like overflow on slicehost where like it just couldn't show me how much bandwidth that how much bandwidth was actually being consumed um so but the project as a whole was pretty fun i think it um it ended up getting like a couple hundred thousand installs on the iphone again back before the app store and then um then it was like ported to the hundred dollar laptop like the olpc because sure these are being shipped to you know like everywhere in india yeah and obviously most of these people don't actually have internet access and so this is kind of how you can read wikipedia without it it's really cool um so anyway we were sort of john and i were kind of working on side projects like this um but um and you know somewhere along the way started came along yeah so um so just tell us a little bit about that so you you're you're implementing you're trying to actually solve you know you solve this problem yourself right you're actually implementing merchant accounts and like trying to set up a payments on your on one of these projects or how did it come about so actually what happened is um so one of the projects that i'd worked on uh back a few years previously was just trying to build a better web framework in lisp and you know i was i guess i was right that you know better web frameworks are interesting but i was very wrong in thinking that like anyone would use you would use lisp um but i guess sort of by or 10 or whatever it was uh we'd both build tons of web applications but we'd never charge for any of them um like we literally never charged for any of the software that we'd built on the web uh and we started wondering why that was um and and we looked back and we realized that we'd actually sort of started applying for merchant accounts at like various points or we'd sort of like taken the first steps for like integrating with paypal but just it never quite been sort of the biggest priority at any one time and just the net result is that we had never sort of taken a single payment on the web um and then we're sort of really taken with uh probably kind of happening in in other industries where there were these kind of very developer oriented services coming along and sort of building these really nice abstraction layers over sort of some particular piece of infrastructure just making it really easy to go and and do something so in the obvious examples are things like lenod or slice host or ec2 for hosting uh also obviously twilio for telephony just like a lot of these companies and so um i think it was october of 2009 or something we sort of had this idea that you know maybe maybe it would be kind of interesting to build slice hosts for for payments and that's how we thought of it it was a slice host for payments um i i guess a bunch of you have probably like used some of these hosting providers but at the time ec2 was still sort of very bare bones and there wasn't really much of a web interface and it was we had to use all these command line tools to administer it um whereas slice host had this like really nice slick gui where you could just start like you could like click build server and like 60 seconds later you'd have a server and we sort of wanted that like magical instantaneous experience for payments sure and so i so uh paul graham has talked about used you guys as this example is of you know really attacking very very difficult problems and people that he he uses comparison of how many like recipe websites he's gotten you know how many pitches he's gotten over the years versus no one ever pitched this idea so and because it was so big it was you you're solving such a huge problem um where did you even start i mean where where does something like that even begin um so so we didn't really know uh where to start uh and like i definitely wouldn't pretend that we did uh and i mean i would have started by like crying you know in the fetal position or something i mean it's like you know i did you it's just you and your brother right so basically we faked it um so what we did was um we decided to go on holiday and just like go hack somewhere uh and maybe i i don't know how to pronounce his name um but this is guy uh mache and i'm gonna totally um like he may be here so yeah i'm gonna totally mess up his surname but it's something like settlowski or chetlavsky or something like that i apologize matchy if you ever see this uh his website is idlewords.com and uh and he's a really good writer and he um he wrote this these the series of blog posts about buenos aires uh and how it's like the best place ever to go and hack because it's really cheap and everything's open really late and there's like wi-fi everywhere and the climate's really nice and everything and so john and i were facing this winter in cambridge massachusetts uh which is which is definitely not like that in basically any respect uh and so we decided to go to buenos aires and just um like hack all day in cafes on trying to build a prototype here and so we did that and it turned out to be basically exactly as described and so if ever like you just want to go and like work on something sort of single-mindedly for a month i cannot recommend uh but i raised more highly we spent like ten dollars a day and the weather was gorgeous and like bizarrely all of the cafes have wi-fi for no reason that i concerned like much more than the extent here and all the restaurants open really late and that we were turned away from restaurants at like nine o'clock in the evening because it was too early and all the bars are open until like five a.m people when we start going to bars at 2 a.m and nobody gets up before midday and so basically it's like an entire city on a hacker's schedule and and we were like the worst tourists ever in that i still have not seen like a single site or anything that's gonna direct we just like got up and went to a cafe and like hacked all day um at the end of that we had the first prototype of stripe um after a month after yeah after a month or i guess we like the first we're the first production user actually about a week after going to buenos aires um and what we did was we just like uh called up a friend who worked at a pain processing company and said you know is it okay if we just kind of send a couple of accounts your way and uh and we sort of built sort of this really nice uh kind of you know the this nice api and sort of you know interface for setting up accounts or whatever and then you know when you sort of clicked create account or whatever rather than uh you know an account actually being created sort of in the financial infrastructure you know however that worked we had no idea we just like went and called our friend um which you know scaled to at least a couple of users uh and so we um and you set it up all manually look behind yeah it's totally manual um and uh and i mean you know at this point uh like we had literally two users uh yeah and both of them were like good friends of ours uh and and so paul buchheit has this great story about um about building gmail uh where like he kind of repurposed um the google groups code which predates gmail to build gmail and so uh like he built the first working prototype in an afternoon and you know it just uh it loaded all of his email into like the google groups interface and he could kind of browse in the google groups interface and he like showed his friends and they're like clicking through and they're like oh this is great you know but would be really awesome if instead of viewing you know your email i could view mine and it was this like very kind of direct uh user requester and development um and it was sort of similar to this with stripe and then we sort of like built the api that allows you to charge credit cards and so you know went on on user requests from there and so ross boucher was actually the very first user of stripe um he was at a company called tuition north at the time and uh and he's like you know this this api is great you know but what'd be really awesome is if you know you actually transfer the money into my bank account after i you know charge credit cards right fair uh and and similar requests like this um and so what it didn't actually it didn't actually it didn't go anywhere because i thought you're setting this up on the back end for him or no yeah i i i can't remember it's all fuzzy math at this point but but it was very um it's very much driven by basically you know what things they bugged us to build sure and so we launched this prototype and and again i i sort of you know you're not back from argentina or yeah so so by the time you say got back from argentina at the end of january um sort of the the product existed and actually existed in sort of fairly close form to what stripe is today like just this this really simple notion that you can you can go to a website like by filling it in a really minimal amount of information you can start accepting credit cards immediately on the internet and the like the the fundamental idea is that it should be possible to launch a website and accept payments on it within like 30 minutes yeah you know before stripe was you know this multi-day yeah it's week yeah it's five seven business days something right uh and i mean that's when sort of got hard right because kind of figuring out what the sort of software side of stripe should look like i mean you can kind of imagine it but then like how do you possibly reconcile all of that with like the financial infrastructure and merchant accounts and gateways and laws and pci and like and they're just like the words we knew um and uh and so we went back to school and we sort of finished the next semester and we decided to to work in it um uh and palo alto over the next summer and i guess that's when we that's when we started working full-time on strike i guess about a year and a half ago okay and yeah i mean so for some background i'm sure a lot of people in this room are have dealt with this but one of my first jobs in my first startup job in college was like signing up or like servicing merchant accounts and it was yeah and it was like 2 000 up front to set it up and it was like another 100 or something a month yep and then there and then the fees kicked in yep and so it was just like for a small business yeah it was insane i mean it was absolutely insane yeah the the fee schedule is for many of our competitors run to like more than one page yeah yeah um yeah i mean it uh like i think every now and again you just stumble across an industry that uh like the the online payments industry was just like an unusually compelling example i think of of an entire industry that is going to have its lunch eaten and you know whether that is stripe or something else like just this is not how the world should work uh and yeah i think um i mean i think i think it'll be very good for the world when fee schedules you know no longer run to two pages so you come back you you you finish your semester school you come back here at the beginning of summer 2010 yeah and um so it's still just you and your brother and then what is the next series of events you you reach out to like up to paul in the in that team are you still just kind of building on your own or so so i guess two things happened um one is uh i guess like a lot of startups we we at this point actually still looked at stripe as as very much um kind of a side project in that we like we're also working these iphone apps whenever and just like stripe was another sort of like interesting thing we had going on the side um and but that that changed over that summer um and what sort of changed was we we thought more about um i guess we thought more about sort of the problem of transactions and the internet and more about sort of the internet in general like what kind of things are holding the internet back and it sort of struck us that sort of like you think of google as uh as really kind of solving the problem of like search on the internet and like if you think of search in the web you know it's very clear that sort of we should have a good solution to search on the web and you know google is a reasonable job version you know maybe you could do better than google but but there's like it's a pretty solid start at least um and similarly you think of like social and the web and uh and you know again say facebook you know perhaps we can do something better but you know pretty good job um and then if you look at sort of just payments or even more generally kind of like the economic foundation of the web it's just it's really it's really shaky and there's just like nothing there and i mean like paypal to some degree i think was at one point on a kind of trajectory to build this but but they've kind of you know they never really got there um and and i mean it took us a long time to realize this it took us kind of six months but but i think that's actually a really big deal in that i mean the web is and the internet are are still very young um but but sort of of all the things we buy instead of all the the like all the transactions we engage in still only like a minuscule fraction of those happen on the internet and like when you think about it it's just like really hard to buy something on the internet today like it's it's it's crazy how kind of manual it is you're like punching your credit card number digit by digital sure go to these multi-stage checkout processes it's incredibly hard to start accepting payments online even if you start accepting payments online it's really hard to transact across borders in that i mean if you have a credit card i mean that's great you can buy from a us user but i mean good luck buying from somebody in you know like in russia or china or brazil or whatever it is similarly if you're a consumer like i mean if you're an american you can buy from other american websites but if you're like a guatemalan or an indonesian i mean you're used to like you're you're restricted like you're you're a small little market um and i don't think this is kind of going to remain the case um in that i think that like there there will be and there should be sort of like a really robust reliable simple straightforward powerful like economic layer for the internet um and sort of whether or not stripe builds that i think that you know we sort of realized that at least the problem space is pretty interesting and pretty meaningful and so but we were kind of coming at it very much from this um this you know fairly uh this kind of humble beginning of like you know building slices but for payments we you know we at least became convinced that there's something there like this might be a somewhat rich theme well what's interesting too is that you didn't start out you know you and john didn't sit down and say you know what we're going to build a you know a payment platform right i mean it was it was it actually sounds like you were doing some of these other side projects that were that were more interesting to you because you're spending more time and they were more fun and then as you continue to think about it as it evolved over time over a span of six or eight months it was like wow actually this thing we created has real potential um and this this kind of leads into something i want to talk about because we constantly hear like you know paul constantly talks about work on big problems people also talk about work on something you're passionate about and i wonder you know is payment something you're passionate about i mean is it absolutely it is yes um i mean i think that it's like it's it's so like it's it's the fundamental enabler uh as in you're you're enabling people like to make a livelihood to like get into business and i think there are actually very few things that are sort of as fundamentally kind of interesting as that and i mean i think the payments sort of at its core is pretty interesting and meaningful but i think like especially on the internet because uh like in a lot of ways like you know many classes of payments are sort of a pretty solved problem and so like there are tons of people sort of competing with you know what's the next way of like buying a cup of coffee at starbucks and like starbucks is a mobile app that allows you to you know pay for your coffee and google are doing google wallet and like there's all this nfc stuff and like you know probably in 10 years i will not hand my credit card to the cashier i'll do something else but but fundamentally like i'll buy my coffee at starbucks whereas on the internet a lot of the transactions that are going to happen uh sort of they've still to be defined we sure don't really know what what's possible and like what things can be built and to the extent we sort of make the experience of sort of transacting on the internet better that just means all this new stuff will be created and so if we build like the better way of buying a coffee at starbucks the world i think will still look basically the same whereas on the internet when you solve this problem i think we'll actually have a pretty different internet uh and so i think it's i'm not sure like it's not immediately obvious to me what what a more interesting problem solving the internet would be and you you've made this comment that 10 years from now the things that will be accepting payments is it's new things it's not you know the majority of the payments that are coming it's not going to be on what we're using today it's going to be on something new and so you're basically creating the infrastructure and creating the platform for that is that right that's cool yeah yeah so okay so you come back to silicon valley um you're continuing you start do you finally say okay we're going to focus on this thing and then and then what happened what happened after that so then um uh i i mean by and large uh we like set up keyboards and like typed um and like 99.9 of the time was was spent doing that um and we i guess by the time the summer started we had a waiting list of i can't remember how many people that i like some number of thousand people uh this is just spreading i mean how do you get it out you have this you have a website that has a sign up page put your email here or we'll email you whenever you told other friends and this kind of stuff yeah um and but but we couldn't we couldn't have them use stripe because uh i mean well i just i guess told you sort of how the account creation process actually happened in the background uh and so we sort of like convinced ourselves that there might be something interesting here um but now we have to sort of actually go and build the infrastructure to make it work and so we decided at the end of that summer that we would sort of go and take this seriously we'd go and build that infrastructure and figure out you know whatever it is that we need to learn and actually launch it properly and so we took some some investment and a y combinator peter thiel elon musk sequoia and jerison horowitz and a few others invested in our seed round anybody we've heard of um and and then we basically spent the next uh i think was 14 months uh building the infrastructure that could actually make this work so from like august 2010 to the end of september 2011 it was like building infrastructure and then we we finally launched it to the public i think like i think was the 30th of september so 2011 2011 so like just over six months ago so uh walking back to that point of raising tell tell us how how do those types of conversations start so you already know paul they've invested in you some of these maybe were some of your previous investors but like you go and you meet with peter thiel and and what happens is it you know walk us through you know your first meeting with peter thiel um so so i remember being very critical of paypal and then sort of halfway through the meeting being like maybe not the best wrong deck right um you know mostly i remember him thinking that a lot of the things we were doing that i thought were a bad idea him thinking they were a good idea and sort of vice versa and that being sort of pretty interesting and so uh at the time uh at the time we sort of wanted to have this forcing function uh that sort of encouraged us to make the product really good uh and so we did we charged five percent plus 30 cents for every transaction which is like way more than anyone else charged uh to process online payments uh and and sort of our thinking was that well we don't want anyone to use us like because of the cost and so rather than try to be even competitive we just price it like way higher than everyone else and kind of until people were willing to use it and like pay that large premium the product sort of wasn't sufficiently better um and but we were sort of but we didn't really think of it as sort of like a viable long-term strategy i remember peter arguing that that it quite possibly could be and that that could be like a really interesting business model um yeah basically you'd provide a better customer service better experience and you could charge a premium like a fundamentally different business model to like every other parent's company um and i i guess i also remember peter being um just like smart and decisive and so within like two hours of meeting he had agreed to invest um and we did like tons of other meetings and like a lot of people had told us that like this was not even possible or like the million reasons we would fail whereas peter pretty in fact he's like okay i will invest um and i think you know i mean that that i think really changed our trajectory and so you you also took y commoner money but you didn't go through the program again you'd been through it right and that's right that's right so yeah we i guess octomatic had gone through a combinator and um uh i mean stripe sort of already existed and i guess are we for no particularly good reason actually yeah we didn't end up going through the program again like i think kind of if i had to go back and look at that decision again it'd be kind of 50 50 as to whether or not we should but um but yeah we we didn't go through with that can you talk about what what are some of the i mean we you know y combinator you know it's clear they provide you know financing there's some mentorship there but what what are the as somebody that's that's now you know been a part of two companies that have that have been invested through that program what are what are some of the tangible benefits that that people get from or intangible benefits are the only thing about they get through going through y combinator um so there's a bunch of them um i think that like for us one thing that was really valuable was um having all these alumni and just being part of this network of other startups i mean we were building a service that uh like whose initial user users at least included a bunch of other startups and so having kind of all these other people who knew they were building startups excuse me and being able to say to them oh you guys should use stripe instead of having them want to help us because we're a fellow accommodator company i mean that was just super valuable for us um and that basically otherwise why commentary users were our users and i think maybe our first 10 or 20 users were all yc companies um that was really helpful um i guess i presume like many if not most of you here have startups themselves and you know it turns out that startups are really hard um and just like having a bunch of other people around you who are sort of you know doing the same thing and like get that i think is really really nice and valuable um but actually i think that the like why color talk quite a bit about i think more than than most um sort of similar incubators or whatever you call that class of like seed fund against ease it um i think that they talk sort of more than most of what their value is and what they do and they have actually this like really detailed document on the yc site describing just like what yc is and what what you do um and they talk about some of the benefits like that they sort of they have a ton of data like they see hundreds of companies and so you know they can just kind of apply sort of aggregated other companies experience to your experience and just sort of provide helpful data-driven advice in that way or the alumni network or whatever it is um but i feel like yc can't actually sort of kind of it's difficult for them to talk about the biggest advantage of yc which is simply the appalling of their partners are really smart and i feel like they can't really sort of write this document that sort of you should do yc because we're really smart um but i think that's actually kind of the the best reason to do ic in that uh like paul initially and the other partners and the other partners who've joined are just really really really good um and i mean i guess with stripe we've been kind of lucky where we got to or like do get to work with like lots of good investors but like there's no question that yc are at the like very top tier and when you say good and smart are you talking about like product feedback or uh you know execution or you know technology or what what exactly do you mean yeah so there was this um i got a month ago or something there was this meme going around facebook of like what my mom thinks i do and like what my friends think i do and like whatever else for like all these different professions yeah um and uh i feel like you know the world thinks startup founders are like thinking all these strategic thoughts and like refining in their chair thinking you know how to deal with the next big threat or whatever it is and um or like what the next you know giant breakthrough will be whereas in fact most of your time is spent you know like this particular thing is broken and the person who is going to fix it like had to go home and i like you to fix it or like this investor has this question to produce this document and like it's just like it's it's you know all these distractions one after another like i think basically experience you're doing a startup it's just like dealing with distractions you know in serial um and uh and i mean sometimes the issues are actually huge like you're trying to like you know close this round with this big deal and there's you know some like recalculate investor or like stressful thing happening or it's you know i i don't know how to talk to this customer or like whatever it is but you know it really kind of spans the gamut um and i think like to your question like what are they actually good at i think you know paul and the other partners are really good at like just like getting that i mean they've done companies and uh they've seen this happen like literally thousands of times in other companies and so whether the issue is like closing this round or doing this big deal or this acquisition or whatever or it's just well like how should the sign up button work um they're uh they're pretty good advice and that that's i mean that has made a big difference to stripe talk about just a little bit then we'll get back to stripe um talk a little bit about paul graham you you uh you know you know paul graham probably as well as as as any of the yc founders do uh what makes paul graham specifically so good what makes him unique um and uh you know how how has he helped you and your startups um he kind of reminds me a bit of peter thiel actually and he uh he just makes these surprising connections and comes up with these like surprising ideas uh that um you know that are things that i have not thought of and i mean like i guess i feel like lots of investors are sort of pretty good at the kind of quotidian things like you know helping you close other deals or you know you have a question of you know how some how should i grant options or like what lawyers should they use i mean there are a lot of investors that i think can give you pretty good advice there and like usually i find the conversations that are most kind of useful with paul are like uh thinking about some like totally new area or something and go to paul and you just i come back with sort of ten to ten ideas that i had not thought of and like some of them are really outlandish and like terrible ideas and you know some of them are good uh and i i don't know i think that like both paul graham and peter thiels have this property where they sort of look at the world kind of sideways and just like see it slightly differently to everybody else and i'm not sure if that's kind of an acquired thing or that's kind of a consequence of having seen so many other companies or something they actually kind of explicitly put effort into or whatever but regardless of what it is i think that's i don't know that's the thing that most strikes me about is there anything that he's not very good at um you can take that as a no he's not very good at uh he's not very good at some feigning interest um in in something that he doesn't care about and so uh you know if he'll get like really taken with like some particular thing that you you know you could do with the business and you'd be like um and then you know you'll move on to some other topic and for example say you're talking like how you should issue options and uh and now you're like thinking about how you should issue options and like paul is sort of 10 minutes back in the conversation thinking and you know what you should really do um and and that's actually you know this like giant take over the world plan with you know some like path that you have never thought of um yeah great so uh so you launched six months ago and tell us so at this at this point how big is the company um you know you guys were based down here you've now moved to the city but what uh you know how it's it's more than just you and you and your brother actually and the guy from 280 north joined your company right your first customer actually joined your company um actually several of our customers joined stripe um so one of the things that turned out to be really nice at building kind of a service for their startups is that uh you meet all these people who you like love to work with um and so we've repeatedly had the experience of uh like somebody built something on top of stripe and uh and sort of over the course of just them building on stripe we got the chance to interact with them a lot and um and we're just like really impressed uh and you know like you know building this business on top of stripe is great but you know we'd love to to have you actually just like bill stripe itself um and so uh now we're so i think we launched we were eight people or so um now i think we're 23. um and like i'll say the i think it was eight that we were when we launched i think that four or five were stripe users and so that's how um how we came across them um and uh and i guess of the uh the 20-something the the vast majority are our engineers and so mostly i mean when we launched um uh like i don't think stripe is actually sort of like all that incredible an idea or anything and i think it's kind of an idea that's been in the air for a while just like finally we'll make payments just like not really suck on the internet and so i think that the reaction just straight to a large degree was like oh great payments now like don't suck anymore uh and and since we launched uh it's it's very much been just like trying to keep up with the growth where like it turns out that all these people who want to use the payments earth doesn't suck um and so uh just like there's been tons of sites um like going live on stripe every day and yeah mostly we've just been trying to keep up with that and uh and so you grew one to a thousand just based on word of mouth how have you grown you know is it been the same have you guys it's it's all been word of mouth so far i mean word of mouth for like people writing about us on blogs or like the thing that we really like and um and and you know it is really kind of meaningful for us when it happens is sort of when people just like write about their experience of integrating stripe because uh i mean that that's like that's the goal we just want to make it super simple um for people to to build a business on the web and like that is the thing we're kind of always asking ourselves like how could we make it easier for somebody to start building a business on the internet uh and and yeah we've done no marketing so far um or actually we we started like running some limited ads and like stack overflow and stuff like a week ago but up to that it was it was all either um word of mouth or stuff that our users wrote about stripe and again i think that's uh we sort of intentionally held off marketing for a long time because again it's that forcing function again like if our users aren't talking about stripe well i mean then we should make stripe more awesome like until they do and i think that sort of like marketing and like sales teams and all that kind of stuff they can be sort of really useful kind of accelerant when you when you're really confident that you have the product right but i think that uh it's it's i think that um i came across this this quote i think it was yesterday from um from eugene kleiner about like how even turkeys can uh can fly in a high wind um i think there's kind of something like that for startups um where like you know with enough sales and marketing you can make even like a really crappy product successful and so i think we're sort of but by not doing any marketing for a long time it's you know making sure that we're like not this like hapless flandering turkey and so i mean now we i guess we've some nice um at least suggested evidence that you know people like the product and stuff and so you know now we're much more okay with sort of like i guess there's two sides to it like on the one hand you want to make sure you're not in turkey and but then when you're like okay i'm not a turkey uh the other trap i think that you can fall into is i think a lot of um engineers and i mean i see this trading myself um kind of have this sort of um i don't know like this solipsism or kind of this uh this kind of self-centeredness or something where like i'm going to build my beautiful codes you know over here in the corner and like i'll wait for the world to discover me and yeah i'm just going to focus on all these technical problems um but i think you you really have to go and like engage with the world and like talk to you and like tell them about what you're doing and why it's meaningful and everything and and yeah you don't do that sort of or like there is some value i think in holding off doing that initially or just like not kind of pushing it too hard because it's it's really nice to sort of to to wait till it gets to the point where people will actually sort of discover you but once you've got to that point and like you think you actually have the thing then i think you should go and tell the world and like really bring it to people um and so i think that you know over the coming years we'll we'll try to do that more but um but there's some value in holding off a lot so you're currently in in how many countries are you in which countries are you in um well so you can look in two ways um so if you if you have a visa or like mastercard or whatever branded credit card it will work with a stripe user so we have like purchasers from almost every country in the world however if you want to accept payments with stripe and like sign up with stripe uh you have to be based in the u.s today um and and that is like the biggest bug with stripe right now uh in that i mean the whole promise of the internet is you know we'll break down borders and like there'll be this incredible like shiny you know global like real-time exchange of information uh and sort of we're trying to sort of build a concomitant um economic layer but i mean it's frankly just broken right now and that like you can only accept payments if you happen to be sort of physically resident in the united states just that makes no sense on the internet um and so we're working on fixing it uh and i think that so at least when we launched i think that a majority of the people working at stripe um were born outside of the us and like grew up not being u.s citizens and so but it was just you and your brother the company though right well no i mean probably launching we were like whatever eight people or nine or whatever was um like even then there were like a ton of non-us citizens yeah or people who at least didn't start out being us citizens and um i mean like the thing like when you build a startup you mean you always care like uh you you always want your mom to be able to use it like sure you know whenever like i talk to my mom about stripes she's like can i use stripe yes i'm like no mom and uh and so yeah i mean we uh you're working on it we're working on i think you know you even now you have a big announcement here right exclusive i wish i wish um dang i think now at 20 something people stripe is still like 50 non-us and so um you're cranking on it we feel this bike pretty acutely yeah um so i will get to you the audience's questions here in just a minute i just want to ask you one more thing you know um paul talks a lot about going after real problems difficult problems and uh i reached out to your to your younger soon to be very very famous brother tommy and uh he's 16 and i i he got this email back from him and and i leaned over to the to russ who's sitting across me i just said geez i i want this guy to write my obituary like today he's just amazing you know he wrote this i was like so tell me about just tell me something what makes patrick unique and it and it really feeds into this and he just said oh christ yeah uh-huh i'm writing it patrick is a son no um he said that he basically said you have unique outlook on life that very little is truly impossible and i i just it's deep it's really really deep um so i just keep deprived or something you know you know speaking to an audience of entrepreneurs and founders who you know like myself you know i build mobile games and social apps and stuff like where does the motivation come or or how do you start to work on a really really hard problem and and um and when it and how do you keep at it because you've obviously hit these very difficult steps along the way and you guys have stayed with it yeah and uh so i think that the biggest thing that i didn't realize about you know quote-unquote hard problems when i'm starting out um is that uh they're harder in sort of like a specific way and that i mean like you you pick some giant challenge like say it's fixed healthcare um and and i mean just like fixing healthcare i mean it's really hard isn't there all these like obstacles and bureaucracies in your way and it's not even clear how you should fix healthcare and all this stuff um but it's also like all these hard problems i think are actually easier in a way which is that it's much easier to to uh it's much easier to inspire other people to work with you and it's much easier i think even just like to inspire like yourself to work on this problem uh in that sort of you wake up in the morning and i mean i don't pick any particular example because i think it's very easy to sort of wrongly denigrate things that look trivial but i mean if the thing is actually trivial i mean it's just sometimes you wonder like why am i doing this is that really is this really what i sort of thought of you know doing it you know whatever stage in my life and whereas if you're doing something like really hard and really meaningful um i think that that just on on some kind of like metaphysical level makes it all easier and you mean you're trying to convince somebody that you really admire to work with you and uh i mean if you're working on something that that actually is trivial i mean you you're kind of faintly embarrassed and you know like you want to come work in my thing and but you can't really put your heart and soul into it whereas if you really are working on sort of something that your heart and soul is in fact in um then i think that just that makes it easier and so i think that like people are pretty good at dealing with i think like kind of the sort of mechanical challenges of a hard problem and and the ones that are that are that like really cause you to lie awake at night are the um for for lack of a better term like the metaphysical philosophical ones or whatever i think that like working on hard problems almost definitionally uh you know solves at least that second class in that you you picked the thing that you really think is meaningful um so so i think actually hard problems is actually a bad term for it because they're sort of like like hard easy problems um and yeah i think that helps great can we give patrick a round of applause let's take a couple of questions anybody have a question and i'll just yeah devin in the back and i'll just repeat it you mean like in the chrome store or whatever um so i mean from the so i guess the question is around sort of google payments and kind of how that relates to us in a competitive sense um so when we started out uh i mean i mean it turns out strike was not in fact the first online payments company we realized pretty soon um so there was like this legacy industry of merchant accounts and gateways and all that stuff and there was obviously paypal and amazon had a payments product uh google had google checkout um this kind of there always has been probably continued to be talk of like facebook doing a payments thing and so like basically every major technology company had like done a payments thing at some point and so it's like a pretty crowded landscape um i think that like none of these companies including google sort of really care about payments at their core like it's not core it's like like google is not a payments company it's a search company and i think that uh like for anything including payments it's really hard to to do to do anything really well instead of uh i mean if it's not your core focus uh and i think i mean if you if you look at google checkout and just like look at it as a product i mean it's just not all that all that good a product um and in today's i don't even really fully understand why like why like large organizations are sort of not capable of building good product instead of areas they don't care about um i think payments i think that sort of applies to almost anything i think within like another decent example is just like uh quora versus facebook questions like on paper facebook questions sort of crushed quora and i mean obviously it it didn't um i think with payments specifically there's kind of a secondary aspect where the payments companies it seems need to be perceived as kind of neutral and that the payments companies that have done well historically have not been those that sort of have their fingers and lots of pies and sort of have this weird kind of like platform there to the payments aspect but also kind of somewhat competitive or whatever and so for example i think amazon payments really has this challenge where if you're a large if you're like walmart for example why would you use amazon payments and like send all this data to amazon who are also in your competitor and so i mean google has that say less than amazon but i think there's that aspect there and so i think that just yeah if you look historically the companies that have done best have been those have been kind of neutral so um but i mean ultimately i guess it's it's it's a belief thing that we think that we can build a better place for it to google and i mean i guess you know the the the future will tell that that's actually the case anybody else yeah go ahead talk about your view on patents how do you how does stripe feel about patents uh i guess like almost everybody else in the industry we're um we're pretty opposed to software patents um i think that uh i think it's really well i mean the the real problem with patents is uh like is the kind of the game theory of it where like kind of no matter what your um what your belief and software patterns are you are severely disadvantaging yourself or like you the company by by not pursuing software patterns because kind of everyone else will and it's sort of this arms race um and so i think that and i think kind of to to break that that kind of equilibrium we either need to change the law or uh just kind of change the structure in some clever way like for example with what twitter is doing and i think that the twitter i mean if you actually go read the legalese i'm not convinced that the twitter approach is actually um is actually sort of the right solution that for example that allows offensive use of patent patents rather uh even in cases where sort of the the um the defendant is sort of just believed to be a future patent threat as opposed to somebody who's actually taken a lawsuit um but i i i'm actually pretty uh there are lots of things i sort of despair about but software patents aren't one of them because i think that we're just kind of living in this stupid time right now where we're being kind of stupid about software pads but i think it's actually a fairly i i think we'll fix it i think we'll fix it in you know within five years um because i think it's just pretty clear that software patterns are a net bad idea and i guess i've you know i don't think we're capable of fixing it like terribly quickly but i think we'll get there so yeah go ahead yeah so what specifically does stripe do different from paypal so it's a little bit hard to um to to kind of answer that question directly just because paypal is sort of not this like one monolithic product but it's sort of this like large you know this large cluster of products flying into the loose formation um and so uh like the the core people product when sort of people think about is you know this thing that appears in a website you you know you click pay with paypal you go to the paypal website you enter your credentials there and you know you sort of rolls around the paypal vortex for a while then you like end up sort of hopefully end up back yeah right um and your stripe is better than that paypal experience because the checkout experience happens like right there on the page it's like people building a site on the internet sort of want to have a payment experience that's sort of just as good as like the best sites in the internet like you want your payment form but it feels like my payment right it feels like my if it's my products on my website it feels like it's my yes payment process and you want to be able to sort of integrate into the flow of your site sort of in a way that's natural and make sense and not have to like you know throw people over onto these other websites and like hope they come back um and uh and so yeah i think that that's kind of i i guess the other part is that you um with paypal kind of this is kind of adverse um adverse selection kind of negative signaling problem where you got to look a little bit more like a mom-and-pop or you know like smaller operation if you use paypal just just because all the best companies insist on going and like getting a merchant account and they're willing to invest the weeks that it takes to do that um and so so we're sort of better than sort of that particular paypal right because uh i mean we sort of provide the first class experience um but i mean there are other paypal products in it it's i mean it's hard to kind of go through them one by one but i think the at a metal level um we feel that stripe is a more compelling product than paypal because like not so much because it's sort of a featureless comparison though you know we can do that featureless comparison i think stripe does very well in it but just kind of add a like if you compare um if you compare the iphone and android on like a feature checklist that they look like basically the same product and yet if you use an iphone and an android phone for for five minutes like it's it's night and day like they are just such different products and just have such such radically different kind of quality of execution and like it's you know user experience i think there are valid reasons to choose android you know things like the app review process and like all that stuff but just like they're very different things and i'm not claiming that sort of stripe is iphone and paypal is the android but just kind of there's kind of um there's something philosophical um in these products the iphone and the android that just like differ and it's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is but it's there and so with stripe we have a very firm belief about sort of like what this product is and how the payment should work it should be a really simple api it should be integrated onto your website everything should be really fast and beautiful and simple and with paypal they have like tons of different products and certain permutations and like different pricing schedules and you know the interfaces a little bit data and all these things but like it's not one single thing that separates them it's just kind of this this underlying philosophy um so i'm not sure that actually answers the question but better comparison might be stripe is like iphone 2 paypal it's blackberry kind of like that that's kind of how i look at it i mean that's my two cents okay yeah go ahead ex-paypal guy right here so yeah let's hear it yeah yeah i've heard of them what are your thoughts on chirpify enabling payments like gumroad kind of like that um so so i don't know tripify super well i mean i've looked at the website um but i'm not all that familiar with the product but i think that the no i'm going to try to dodge the question instead talk about the the uh the general concept here mostly because i'm just not all that familiar with sherpa five but sort of at a meta level i guess um triple five sort of uh building kind of or helping build or facilitate kind of more lightweight forms of commerce uh in that you know commerce need not be sort of going to amazon and putting a thing in your cart and basically like a recreation the supermarket experience online but it can be something sort of much more casual and just like you know buying something at a stand or something and i think on a kind of on a on a philosophical level that's that's a really promising direction that i think that sort of the internet of 10 years time when we have this sort of better economic foundation whatever it looks like and we'll it's not that sort of will be making much more sort of 300 purchases so i think we'll be making much more casual purchases and just kind of giving value to way more people than just having a much lower kind of activation energy there and the extent that sort of shopify is doing things like that by integrating it into twitter i think that that's that is a really promising avenue so i guess that's what i feel yeah um so what are what are some of the solutions that you have in place to deal with fraud right um so i think this question is actually really interesting because um kind of when people think of online payments one of the first things i think of is fraud because i mean everyone could have heard the horror stories from paypal um and sort of like in how they almost went out of business you know because of the russian mob and like all these crazy stories and and i think that a lot of the kind of the subtlety of the stories have been lost a little bit um in that for example with paypal uh even at their time the times of sort of their greatest losses they actually had a pretty good idea of where the fraud was coming from and even how they could how they could mitigate it but they sort of made the determination in hindsight correctly that uh that they could afford the losses and the kind of additional growth they got by sort of taking on these kind of somewhat suspect users it was just worth it um and and eventually they sort of got better at sort of detecting the fraud and and you know it became less of a problem and if you look at paypal's fraud losses today they're actually very low i i do think still that that um well and alongside paypal then i mean paypal processes a very small fraction of all of all online transactions like the vast majority are processed by this kind of legacy infrastructure again of merchant accounts and gateways and everything else and these companies you know they don't have these um insanely brilliant sort of mathematicians and programmers and ml people and big data people sort of curating these models i mean they apply a fairly simplistic approach to fraud and and just turns out that that actually works um and so uh i i think that i mean fraud is is just not the um the kind of existentially challenging problem for an online payments company that people tend to to kind of extrapolate from the people experience to assume that it is um i do think that i think one of the mistakes that people's made on fraud is that they just don't like i i feel like they look at it sort of from a very mathematical standpoint and they they sort of think oh well if i shut down this user you know there is x probability that i'm wrong that they're um they're a false positive um and and you know like the the loss in that case of making an incorrect decision is the last of the sort of the profit that i make on this user uh whereas of course that's not the loss the loss that you make is the giant reputational hit from somebody talking about paypal and telling their friends and like sharing this experience of how paypal like like literally in many cases took away their livelihood and i think that sort of that that sort of short-sighted or like miscalibrated mathematical model is actually a very dangerous way to model fraud and so we're really conscious of that at stripe and i think that um yeah i mean we we can do some things to sort of convince you that we're trustworthy and safe and everything else and you know we're audited to the most stringent sort of security level as possible and we we've hired people like uh we've hired people from other companies who have spent tons of time dealing with fraud and you know know the industry really well and this kind of stuff but i think ultimately what it boils down to is we do not intend to have these stories appear of like how stripe took away my livelihood um and i think that like a lot of it comes down to that and that we we simply um we're not willing to make those mistakes and that we're not willing to look at some individual users loss as being you know the loss of that profit i think it's much much larger than that um but yeah i guess coupled with that i guess very sort of emphatic um view of the the downside of being wrong on fraud the the slightly more um encouraging side is that you know it's pretty hard but it's not quite as hard as i think everyone assumes so hopefully we'll do okay great can we give patrick a big round of applause thank you very much",

        "text": "hey so you're interested in starting intermittent fasting or maybe you have a family member or friend that's interested in starting it well this video is going to be your entire overview it's gonna give you everything you need to know to get started with intermittent fasting so the cool thing is intermittent fasting is were really easy to get started on now the caveat is there are some little intricacies that you need to be paying attention to that's exactly why I created this video in some serious detail so what we're gonna cover in this video is a number of different things and I'm gonna go down the line so you have a solid idea of what we're going to cover so first off we're gonna talk about what is intermittent fasting and why you shouldn't overthink it okay we're gonna talk about the basic benefits not gonna spend a whole lot of time on that because if you're watching this video you're probably already interested and your curiosity has been piqued because you know someone that has had crazy success with it but we're gonna talk about the physical benefits affect fat loss and some muscle gain we're gonna talk about the mental and the focus benefits we're also going to talk about the cellular rejuvenation benefits but again not gonna spend a lot of time there these are the main things I want to cover so make sure that you pay attention so that you don't miss this section of the video that's why I want to lay it out before we even get started so number one I'm gonna tell you how you start a fast okay how you actually literally what you do before you start fasting then I'm gonna talk about how long you should fast for okay how much time should you spend not eating okay then I'm gonna go into number three let's talk about what can I consume like can I consume coffee tea what can I consume during a fast and what will break a fast this is very very important and I'm gonna reference a couple of studies that make some sense of some pretty cool things they're gonna make getting into intermittent fasting a little bit easier for you then I'm going to talk about how to break your fast this is very important very strategic I've done some videos on this that have literally close to a million views because it is such a popular question so you're gonna want to pay attention to that then I'm gonna talk about when you should actually workout or should you work out at all I'm gonna break that down gonna give you a little bit of science there as well we're talking about the different types of fasting because there's intermittent fasting there's some liquid style fasting there's prolonged fasting there's various kinds of fasting you need to know which one is right for you and then we're gonna move in to fasting for men versus women there are some slight subtle differences that you need to pay attention to and they're only going to make your experience better it's not about danger and you think it's just about making sure that you are doing the right kind of fasting for who you are okay then we're going to talk about the common concerns these are big ones they're gonna want to stick with me through the end of the video because I promise everything's gonna make sense and then this is gonna connect all the dots and get rid of any of that confusion alright so we're gonna talk about the whole muscle lost concern we're going to talk about the thyroid because a lot of people wonder if it's going to slow down your thyroid we're going to talk about when to take your supplements so should you take them in your fasting period or when you're eating or what we're also going to talk a little bit about alcohol consumption how does it affect your fast what should you do so now we've got the general breakdown let's go ahead and get started I'm gonna get this out of the way because it's this kind of weird looking and ugly so I'm gonna get this other way you come back sit down we'll get started hey so you were tuned in to the Internet's and number one performance and nutrition optimization channel so the new videos coming out every single Tuesday Friday and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time and a bunch of other videos in between including live broadcasts live coaching broadcasts and all kinds of other fun content so I want to make sure that you also hit that little Bell button so you can turn on notifications so you know whenever I do go live after you subscribe alright so let's go ahead and let's get down to what intermittent fasting is first and foremost so simply put intermittent fasting isn't a diet intermittent fasting is a meal timing plan so basically what you're doing is you're focusing on a specific period of time in which you are abstaining from food and abstaining from calories and then you have a set period of time in which you consolidate all of your food all of your calories so you're basically going for an extended period of time and not eating fasting and then you're going into a period of time where you are eating your fed window so one of the biggest problems that people make with fasting is they overthink it okay they tend to complicate things and it's human nature for us to do that so you really need to keep it very very simple intermittent fasting is just not eating for a set period of time and then consolidating your calories there's a lot of different intricacies in-between but for all intents and purposes that's the goal so let's briefly talk about the benefits okay there are huge physical benefits and that's probably the main reason that people are attracted to intermittent fasting and it's a good chance if that's why you're watching this video right now okay physical benefits include dramatic dramatic fat loss all while maintaining muscle okay also increasing muscle tone increasing muscle density and there's some other general things like actually improving your vascular function as well that can improve your look so in addition to helping out your skin helping out your appearance in that regard there are other benefits too like your nails your hair all kinds of things simply because of the nutrient uptake that occurs so without going into exquisite detail basically you have these physiological functions that occur mainly because of the release of what are called catecholamines adrenaline norepinephrine stuff like that that allow your body to tap into fat stores and preserve muscle when you go an extended period of time it allows your body to start tapping into its fat reserves plain and simple the cool thing is you have a lot of different hormone functions that are preventing you from burning up or losing muscle so you get all the benefits of fat loss without losing your muscle okay I digress a little bit then we have the mental benefits you see what ends up happening is when you're on any kind of fasting protocol you're going extended period of time without eating when you go an extended period of time without eating your brain goes into somewhat of a survival mode now this sounds bad but it's actually good because what ends up happening is when your brain goes into survival mode it gets hyper focused very very focused because it preserves the energy into whatever the task is at hand so instead of having all these extra thoughts you're able to focus on what you really want to focus on and in today's society it's very difficult to find true focus so fasting is very powerful for that but additionally it also allows you to produce what are called ketone bodies you may have heard of ketosis before but it actually doesn't really necessarily mean the same thing as it does with fasting your body produces ketones which are a tremendous brain fuel explain a little bit more in other videos then we have the cellular rejuvenation side maybe you're watching this video because you're interested in sort of the cellular benefits the overall health benefits of intermittent fasting you see what happens in your fasting is something occurs in your body known as autophagy autophagy is the process where old cells get eaten up by newer cells and it consolidates them into stronger more powerful efficient cells so therefore making your skin glow better making you live longer and improving all kinds of organ function so you combine these together you can see why your friends and family might be pushing you to try intermittent fasting so let's go ahead and let's get the details so you can actually get started on your fasting journey all right how do you start a fast now I don't literally mean how do you start fasting okay that part's pretty simple you just stop eating and you're fast hasn't begun but what you eat leading into a fast can make a big difference for example if you eat something that's higher in fiber it's gonna put you in a situation where you're a little bit more satiated so I usually recommend consuming a higher fiber meal prior to starting your fast so if you're going to be fasting from let's say 10 p.m. the night before all the way through to maybe 2 p.m. or 4 p.m. the next day at 10 p.m. you may want to have a little bit of fiber maybe some psyllium husk maybe some vegetables that have a little bit more fiber because what it's gonna do is it's going to allow you to stay satiated for a longer period of time you're still gonna get all the metabolic benefits but as far as your hunger is concerned you're not gonna get these stomach growls you're not going to get all that it's gonna help you out a lot I also recommend having a little bit of fats fats of course you're going to digest a little bit slower but they're also going to leak free fatty acids into your bloodstream a little bit more so you're able to produce those ketone bodies I talked about so a little bit of fat a little bit of fiber and a little bit of protein really pretty simple you don't have to overthink it so a little bit of broccoli with some coconut oil might just be the perfect match for you now the next thing that people like to know is how long should they actually fast when you're fasting the benefit that you're trying to achieve is usually dictated by how long your fast is so what I mean by that is the shorter the fast you're going to be able to get some body composition effects but the longer that you fast you tap more into the cellular rejuvenation effects so what I usually recommend people do is start off with a 16 hour fast this is known as 16-8 fasting so basically what it means is you're fasting for 16 hours and then you have an eight-hour eating window now most of us aren't awake for 24 hours straight so that 8 hour eating window doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be eating the entire 8 hours ok if you were too fast for 16 hours you might be awake for four or five of the eight hour eating window which works out perfectly because it allows you to restrict your calories a little bit more and get more of a metabolic effect so 16 hours is the bare you see after 16 hours you start to have an exponential benefit every hour so 16 hours is where the benefits of fasting really start so if you're fasting less than 16 hours you're still getting a good benefit but you're not getting the same kind of intermittent fasting benefits that occur in the way of auto Fiji and really occur in the way of the cellular rejuvenation that start at 16 hours so I recommend starting 16 and working your way up to 18 or 20 personally I'm a fan of 20-hour fast but that's a hard pill to swallow for someone that's just getting started 16 hours is very acceptable pretty darn easy to do an example of that would be stopping your eating at 10:00 p.m. and then going to bed and then waking up and not eating until 2:00 p.m. that's 16 hours that's really not that bad then you go ahead and you just eat whatever you need to between 2 and say 6 7 8 9 10 p.m. again so you're really in this perfect situation this perfect setup of fasting and eating windows and you again you don't have to eat throughout the entire eight-hour eating window the next thing that you need to know is what you can consume during your fast okay this is very important because a lot of times once you get started fasting you're gonna want to start exploring a little bit you're gonna get curious about different things so I figured I'd give you the breakdown of the things that you truly can consume without any hiccup whatsoever alright so you can consume black coffee don't add a sweetener to it and don't add any creamer to it okay black coffee in and of itself is very very powerful and it actually has some effects on on top of gee meaning it actually speeds up the process of your cells recycling each other there's actually a study those published in the journal Cell cycle that found that the polyphenols in coffee whether it was decaf or caffeinated actually encouraged cells to recycle and go through Auto Fidji much more so than those that didn't have coffee now additionally coffee has a little bit of caffeine in it and believe it or not caffeine supports your fast caffeine not only helps boost fat loss but it also supports autopsy as well so it helps the cellular rejuvenation effects so black coffee is great the issue is once you add the sweetener to it whether it's artificial sweetener that doesn't have calories or not it can trigger an insulin response the other thing that you can sooo ms t go ahead and 1/2 t you're totally fine okay you can have black tea you can have green tea just no sweetener and no creamer in it okay a lot of people are probably wondering what about bulletproof coffee or bulletproof tea we're adding the butter coconut oil to your coffee keep that out of the equation to have a good fast you shouldn't have any calories coming in it should just be basic tee or basic coffee now diet sodas are a little bit of a gray area diet soda is you can have every once in a while but the thing is the artificial sweeteners can still trigger an insulin spike that insulin spike can screw up your fast just because it triggers a metabolic response so if you're going to have a soda I recommend having something that's sweetened with stevia so you're at least getting a natural sweetener that is zero calorie versus bringing in something that's completely artificial and going to trigger what's called an excitotoxin response within your brain water is obviously okay you can consume as much water as you want to unless you're specifically doing a dry fest which I will talk about in a moment now additionally I don't think you should be consuming any bone broth or anything like that some people think that you should be consuming broth during an intermittent fast but there are specific types of fasting that will allow that okay then it comes down to like your pre workouts and your BCAAs and things like that I would not recommend consuming pre-workout during a fast I would recommend leaving on coffee whenever possible and don't consume your branched chain amino acids and here's the big thing the branched chain amino acids can actually break your fast so just keep them out of the equation because honestly you're going to preserve muscle either way because you're in a fasted state where the physiology is working to your advantage now we get into how to break your fast now this is where there are a lot of different methodologies okay I'm a big fan of taking care of your insides first okay you can't get in good shape you can't look amazing and feel amazing if you're not taking care of your organs so I'm a big fan of breaking a fast with some kind of bone broth okay when you break your fast with bone broth it allows the collagen to help restore the gut a lot of times when you're fasting you end up weakening temporarily the gut mucosal layer okay this gut mucosal layer is what protects you from any kind of acid or any kind of just damage in the gut so if you consume some bone broth it can make it so that the gut can actually absorb things better so you don't need much for six ounces but I highly recommend no matter the length of your fast break your fast with some bone broth it helps you out a lot then after that it's very very important that you're not combining fats with carbs that is rule number one okay so as long as you're not combining fats with carbs I'm really okay with whatever you do again there are some intricacies and I've done some detailed videos on how to break it fast before and you can check those out but for all intents and purposes for the sake of this overview you don't want to mix fats and carbs because what happens is carbs cause an insulin spike this insulin spike causes the cells to be very receptive to retrieve whatever you just consume so you can kind of do the math if you consume carbs that trigger insulin the cell opens okay if you've consumed fat at the same time the carbs go into the cell but so does the fat if you consume carbs by themselves just the carbs go in if you consume fat by itself fat doesn't even trigger an insulin response so you're not getting the cell to open so just don't combine fats with carbs either have carbs and protein or fats and protein but not a mix of the two okay now the big one when should you work out when it comes down to your fasting period should you work out when you're fasting or should you work out after you've broken your fast well I can tell you honestly that you can do either one but if you want a little bit more of a physiological body composition effect or should I say a lot more you're gonna want to train in your fasted state here's how I fast I go to bed I wake up and I get my workout in in the morning then I continue to fast the remainder of the day until it's time to break my fast so essentially I'm working out in the middle of my fast even though it's the first part of the full day that I'm fasting a lot of people do like to work out at the end of their fast and this is very very beneficial but it's hard to do if you work out at the end of your fast like right before you break your fast you are most likely to burn the most amount of fat then simply because you're already at the exhausted portion of your fast where your body is already burning fat the problem is you will see some performance decline at that point in time if you work out earlier in the day you still have a lot of strength and stamina from the food that you ate the night prior you're not gonna be weak from the fast yet so you get the benefit of being able to still work out hard without losing the effect of the fast now if you do decide to work out after you've eaten you'll probably find that your strength is quite high but one of the things that you should make sure you're aware of is that you want to digest your food a little bit first as soon as you break you fast all the blood is going into your internal organs it's going to your stomach to help you digest this means that if you go work out your detracting from that you're taking away the blood from the vital organs and sending it out to your extremities to work out this means that you're not absorbing the nutrients in the fashion that you could be if you worked out a little bit later just remember you're gonna have great strength gains but you're not gonna have as much in the way of body composition effects you see there was actually one study that was published in the journal physiology that found that when you workout in a fasted state you burn significantly more fat and it's simply because you have little bits of fat that are actually inside your muscle and they're called intra Maya cellular lipids these intra Maya cellular lipids get evacuated out of the muscle when you workout in a fasted state so they leave the muscle and then go into the bloodstream and the body burns them for fuel so the body takes little bits of fat that are in the muscle put some into the bloodstream and burns them and then the process repeats so fasting and working out is really a powerful way to kind of hack the system a little bit and get a bit more fat burning out of your vest so let's talk about the different types of fasting - okay so this is going to help you determine which one is for you the first one that I mentioned is intermittent fasting that's the basic 16 hour 8 hour split ok maybe 18 6 maybe 20 / 4 depending on what you're up for ok that's basic intermittent fasting the second type of fasting is called prolonged fasting and that's any kind of fast that's a little bit longer we're talking like 24 hours tech fast maybe 24 or 48 hours a little bit less on the body composition benefits and more so just on the cellular rejuvenation benefits of course you're also getting an exponential amount of mental benefits when you go on these longer fast - believe it or not the longer that you fast the more that your mental acuity sharpest you actually get sharper as you fast longer but the physiological body composition effects tend to start to diminish after 24 to 48 hours so don't push it past 48 hours unless you're doing it for specific reason but prolonged fasting is very good to do like once a month or once every quarter or so just to get yourself a little bit of a change of pace and something a little bit more aggressive now another kind of facet you can do is a liquid fast this is where you're still consuming coffee you're still consuming bone broth you're still consuming even bulletproof coffee it's all the things that still have calories but are liquid technically I guess you could drink a soda but I wouldn't recommend it okay so the whole idea of a liquid fast is not about the metabolic benefit it's about giving your digestive system a break I'm not gonna digress too much on that topic cuz I've done another video on that but the point is it's still there and the last kind of fasting it's called dry fasting okay dry fasting is where you don't consume any food or water and this is extreme you should only do dry fasting like once every three to six months honestly what ends up happening when you dry fast is you end up pulling hydrogen from your fat stores to make what's called molecular water now I'm over complicating this for the sake of this video but basically what it means is your body burns more fat because it has to take portion of the fat to make water yes literally fat contains hydrogen which means that the hydrogen in the fat can combine with oxygen that you breathe to make what's called molecular water so dry fasting is effective at burning fat but it's not something you want to do more than once every three to six months so now let's talk about the difference between fasting for men and fascinating for women all in all I don't want you to pay attention to a lot of the crazy nonsense and bro science that's out there on YouTube okay because reality is that men and women are very very similar when it comes down to how the metabolisms work with fasting okay now there's different things and other people will have different arguments on things but when it comes down to women fasting the only thing that they need to be a little bit more concerned with is going to be the fact that because of their reproductive system their body is going to send hugger signals a lot more aggressively it's a little bit more dangerous for lack of a better term for a female to be fasting in a survival standpoint because they need to have extra reserves that are there to carry a child so their body might go into a little bit more of a fighting response it might send hunger signals up through the roof and make them really so if you're a female that's watching this it's just something to be aware of and even though the benefits of fasting don't start until hour 16 you can still get some effects by fasting for a shorter amount of time so maybe start with 12 maybe start with 14 hours and work your way up to it then of course the fasting is pretty straightforward you don't have nearly as much of the complex reproductive system that women have so it's a little bit easier to go ahead and jump into fasting without any concern now let's address the common concerns okay so now you're just about ready to start fasting you're ready to dive in get the biggest benefits but there's still a couple questions that are kind of looming here the first one that I want to address is are you going to lose muscle so to make some sense of this so you don't just think I'm just some random guy on the internet I want to show you a study this study that you can see right now is published in a journal of translational medicine and this study flat-out proved that intermittent fasting versus not intermittent fasting but eating the same amount of calories ended up resulting in subjects not only burning more fat but also building more muscle literally eating the same kinds of foods the same calories the same macronutrients proteins fats and carbs just one group had them allocated to a specific window and one group ate them throughout the course of the day and you'll find that the benefits of intermittent fasting as far as muscle preservation are very very clear in that Journal of translational medicine study so don't worry you're not going to lose muscle you're just gonna burn fat but if you were to go ahead and fast for like three four or five days yeah you might lose some muscle the other concern that comes up is will my metabolism slow down will it affect my thyroid okay the metabolism is kind of a tricky word okay metabolism metabolism is slowing down it's something that people throw around and it's really kind of a tricky way of explaining it your caloric needs are going to decrease if your calories decrease but your caloric needs aren't gonna necessarily decrease if you go for a period of time fasting so as long as your calories are where they need to be you're not gonna slow your metabolism down you're totally fine but the question that comes up a lot is what about my thyroid you see the interesting thing is there's a study that was published in the journal in Turkey knology and this study found that during the fast during the time that you're not eating thyroid function would stay the same but thyroid precursors would start to decrease okay meaning that the production of the thyroid hormone would start to slow down but the actual thyroid hormone itself didn't slow down it's just sort of the machine that created thyroid would start to slow down but the second the subjects ate it came right back you see what ends up happening is of course when you're not eating your thyroids gonna slow down but once you're eating your metabolisms going again so that's not a fair assessment so it is safe to say that while you're fasting you might see a slowdown in your metabolism by standards of your thyroid but once you're eating it all balances back out plus another thing to note is the thyroid rejuvenates very very quick so hypothetically even if it did slow down you'd be back up and running again like ten to fourteen days it's all good another one is when to take your supplements okay because some supplements break a fast and some don't so I'll make this very simple if the supplement that you're taking has carbs or has calories it breaks a fast if the supplement that you are taking is a soft gel like it's an oil like a fish oil pill or coenzyme q-10 that's in an oil okay anything that's in a soft gel is usually suspended in vitamin E or some kind of oil that will break a fast that has a caloric effect that's no different than having oil like olive oil or coconut oil it's just a different kind of oil suspending a fat soluble vitamin consume those like your vitamin D and your fish oil after you've already eaten that way it won't break your fast water soluble vitamins like multi vitamins like vitamin C things like that those are okay to take during your fasting period now I will recommend that you still try to consolidate them during your eating window simply because it can be a little bit hard on your stomach and lastly I want to end with alcohol it alcohol is a pretty interesting one we have to look at how the body processes alcohol when you consume a drink it converts alcohol and what is called acetaldehyde which is a very very toxic thing to your body we all know that alcohol can be hard on the body okay but what ends up happening is the acetaldehyde is so toxic it jumps ahead of all the other food inside your body so what that means is your body still has to have a metabolic effect and it's gonna prioritize alcohol over anything else but one thing that's very important to know is that fat burning occurs from your liver if you're not having a functioning liver if your livers not doing well you're not gonna burn fat very well so if you're asking a lot of your liver to prioritize acetaldehyde from alcohol and ethanol then you're slowing down the process of burning fat so alcohol will definitely break a fast but I highly recommend if you're going to consume alcohol that you do it after you've already absorbed some of your food so go ahead and break your fast and then a couple hours later have a little bit of a drink then that's a safer bet so I hope that this overview has given you a solid perspective on what intermittent fasting is and what intermittent fasting is not honestly it's for everybody you can use intermittent fasting with keto you can use intermittent fasting with paleo being a vegan or whatever you want the thing is intermittent fasting is the proper protocol in which you are not eating versus which you are eating and I want to make sure that you check out the plethora of videos that are on my channel that teach you the different intricacies and the different little things you need to pay attention to when it comes down to intermittent fasting or prolonged fasting thanks for watching and please make sure you subscribe see you in the next video",

        "text": "Alright my darling friends, let's begin with Cat Cow. I'm into tabletop position. And we'll start to move with the breath. Inhale, drop the belly, open the chest, nice and slow. Exhale, round through, chin to chest. Inhale, open the chest, feel the front body stretch. And exhale, rounding through. Naval draws up. Couple more here, move with your breath. Nice and slow. Waking up the body. Setting a mindful tone for the day. One more cow pose, drop the belly. This time really tug the shoulders away from the ears and press into the feet firmly. And then one more cat pose, really arch the spine and claw into the fingertips. Chin to chest. Great work, inhale, tabletop. This time bump the hips to the left and then turn to look past your right shoulder. Feel nice stretch in the side body. Keep the hands and feet rooted to the earth. Then slowly, gently come through center, bump the hips to the right and turn to look past your left shoulder. Again, keep the hands and feet grounded. Continue to breathe here. As we slowly wake up the body with love. Back to center, we go. Drop the elbows right where the hands are. Take a deep breath in. And then on your exhale, slowly walk the knees back, puppy posture or heart to earth pose. A beautiful way to kick off the day. Nice chest opener here. Breathe deep, opening the shoulders. We get the head just under the heart here. Coming some fresh oxygen, fresh blood flow. Then slowly come all the way back up to tabletop position. Again, take your time. Then we'll curl the toes under. Take a deep breath in. On your exhale, send the hips up high, downward facing dog. Headlet out nice and easy. Start to deepen your breath. Shake the head loose. Give thanks for your body. Appreciate yourself for taking this moment to do a quick check-in to move it around. When you're ready, walk the feet to the middle of the mat. Then the knees come into forward fold. Again, we're letting the blood flow opposite direction here. Shake the head loose. Relax through your shoulders. Really feel your feet grounded to the earth here. Again, connect to a little gratitude. Definitely appreciate yourself. Smile. You should feel good, happy, proud that you took this time to connect to your body. Give it some love. Connect to your breath. Bend the knees generously. Bring the belly to the tops of the thighs. When you're ready, we'll slowly roll it up. Nice and slow. Feel your feet press into the earth. Standing in this moment for yourself as you slowly rise up to mountain pose. When you get there, take a moment to move the shoulders a little bit, just soft, easy movement. Continue to deepen the breath. Then see if you can feel it out and align your head over your heart, your heart over the pelvis as you either bring the feet together, really together, or you can choose to go hip with the part. Just nice, mindful footing. Really feel like you're pressing away from the earth as we spread the fingertips. This is that big, good morning stretch. Reach your fingertips all the way up towards the sky. Take a deep breath in. Stretch, stretch, really maximize the stretch here. Give it your all feel. And notice what it feels like to be alive today. Stretch, stretch, stretch even more. And then slowly release, interlace the fingertips behind the back. Knuckles draw down and away. This is our last move here. So draw the shoulder blades together and lift your heart. Open your mind. Take a deep breath in. And exhale, ending with a big hug today. Release the arms. And give yourself a big hug. And I encourage you to lift your heart one last time. Really feel your feet pressing away from the earth. Take one final deep breath in. And exhale, mountain pose. Nice work. Games.",

        "description": "This is Portugal, playing Morocco at the 2018 World Cup.",
        "text": "This is Portugal, playing Morocco at the 2018 World Cup. Portugal was the heavy favorite and won the game 1-0. The result wasn't all that interesting, but this photo is. This Portugal player wasn't born in Portugal, and these Morocco players weren't born in Morocco. See, soccer's regulating body, FIFA, allows athletes to play for any nation they have a clear connection to, including the country of players' parents or grandparents are from. In this year's World Cup, 82 players are playing for countries they weren't born in. So where are they coming from? If we plot it on a map, one country stands out. France is where the largest number of all World Cup players were born. Brazil has the next highest total, but it's not even close. France has had the most native players and coaches in the last four World Cups, and their dominance has been on the rise. So what's so special about France? At the end of World War II, much of France was destroyed. The government began recruiting laborers from southern and eastern Europe as well as colonies in northern Africa to rebuild the country during the late 1940s and 1950s. During that time, France brought in more immigrants than any other European country. And in the 1960s and early 70s, France's economy grew rapidly, and the labor shortage led to another wave of immigrants with even more arrivals from French colonies throughout Africa and the Caribbean. Many of them settled in major housing developments just outside of the major cities. At the same time, France was also in a sports crisis, especially the national football team. Between 1960 and 1974, France failed to qualify for three World Cups and three European Championships. The French football Federation decided the way to get better was to create a national structure for developing talent, so it established one of Europe's first football academy systems. In 1972, a national training center was open in Vichy. And four years later, the Federation worked with top French football clubs to set up a wider network of academies to recruit and train local youth. In 1988, the national training center moved to a forested suburb south of Paris called Clefante. And by the early 1990s, this French soccer system was one of the best in the world, developing talented players all over France. And the system delivered results. In 1998, the French national team called Leblou won the World Cup, a moment that was celebrated throughout the country. It seemed to be a breakthrough for French multiculturalism as well, since several players were either immigrants themselves or children of immigrants who came to France in the 20th century. The team was called Black Blunt Bitt, meaning Black White Arab, a spin on the three colors of the French flag. But not everyone supported diversity, particularly nationalist politicians like Jean-Marie Leppen. Despite racist criticism, players from immigrant families have continued to make up more and more of France's best talent. The French word literally means suburb, but it can also imply immigrant dominated get-ups. Over the years, these areas have frequently seen riots. They have high levels of unemployment, crime, and poverty in our in-acrisis. At the Vanlejo, continued to produce some of the most talented soccer players. That's because this is where France's immigration history meets its soccer system. And it's the reason why the city is the world's number one talent pool for soccer. Since 2002, the number of Parisian-born players of the World Cup has continued to rise. Out of all French players at the 2018 World Cup, 16 were born or raised in greater Paris. And the French national team has eight. That includes Killian Mbappe. France's 19-year-old superstar was born to an Algerian mother in Cameroonian father in the Parisian suburb of Bondi and was trained through the French system at Clefonten. But Parisian players don't just play for France. Over the years, FIFA's eligibility rules have allowed them to play for countries like the Ivory Coast, Morocco, Algeria, Portugal, Cameroon, and Toba. Four players on this year's Senegal team are from the greater Paris area, as well as this player on Tunisia. And remember this photo? Both of these players were born in Paris. That's what special about French soccer. The combination of an established academy system in its unique immigration history is producing incredible talent for France and the rest of the world.",

the product for five dollars and you keep the 15 as profit now some people will tell you that it's dead over saturated but I'm here to tell you now this might be a controversial statement but selling products online is not a dying business no Amazon is dying what insane [Music] brick and mortar however there's one big major thing that I want to introduce and that we're going to be doing differently this time around so in the past they made the most sense to advertise using Facebook ads but as those grew more expensive more strict more regulated and just less effective why am I wearing this nft augmented reality cowboy hat because I don't know where I put my real one but also because there's a new sheriff in town and an ad platform that frankly feels like the wild west Tick Tock advertising I know sounds ridiculous advertising on the endless Scroll of do map that only kids and this guy use shopping for a Rolls-Royce with a 600 beanie yes absolutely right now it's kind of in like this perfect Zone where the ad platform is new enough and there's not enough people using it for the ads to be overly expensive and have the same issues as Facebook ads but it's just developed and advanced enough to where you can definitely get sales with it step one find a product nothing goofy like some lion bracelet from 2015. so there's a lot that plays into what makes a good winning product but for tick tock especially you need to have some sort of wow factor and I personally mainly sell products that solve some sort of problem it's just the easiest type of product to Market you don't need to be a creative genius to sell someone a product that fixes a problem that they already have I was actually going to run this up outside of YouTube because it's really a good product it's unsaturated but I just don't really have the mental capacity for another store right now and I don't want to do you guys dirty and blur it throughout the whole video so I'm just gonna give it up take a guess what does this do introducing the microcurrent device now we all obviously know that when you go to a skin care clinic or Salon there's a treatment you can get called the microcurrent it sends electricity to your face and because our muscles are connected to the skin you end up getting this face lifting effect but you don't want to spend thousands on microcurrent treatments every single week and your time is valuable driving in traffic to the salon waiting in line in the waiting room then you gotta wait for the skin doctor to do their thing then you have to drive back in traffic I have a product that will let you do this all in the comfort of your very own home real jargon I mean come on that's an easy no-brainer swipe up atsu card all seriousness these microcurrent devices self like three to five hundred dollars online and we can get ours for around 15 to 20 dollars shipped from AliExpress so now that we have our product let's build a store step two build a website that doesn't look like an early 2000s infomercial scam it basically needs to look like one of those woke infographics that people will put up on their IG stories after any major world event or social problem comes to life like actually on some neutral Vibes that's basically the aesthetic that you want to go for at least for our product that's in the skin care Beauty niche what are we gonna name our store skin fion what does it mean I don't know well it's it's kind of like contemporary right what what does it mean to you I could easily see skin fion on a billboard or in Sephora so I ended up working on this website for a total of two sessions about two hours the first day and two to three on the second I was hoping to get this done all in one day given our time constraints so second day in we were already kind of falling behind and the possibility of a buska just absolutely started looping over me in an ominous manner this is my all-new Drop Shipping Store and today I'm going to review it I will first give you a tour of all of its quirks and features and then I'll take it out on the road and give it a be treasy score Doug demero reference anyways here we are on the homepage of our store the homepage actually doesn't even really matter because you're going to be sending traffic to your product page and most I'd say like 98 99 of people won't ever get out of the product page to explore the rest of your website so let me actually show you the important part which is our product page everything on here is pretty simple but I think it looks kind of clean we have a product description with some before and afters some how to use type menus and then a video of how the product actually works and then scrolling all the way down that's where I imported all of the reviews step three create an advertisement that looks like it was made by someone over the age of 12. okay so it's day two we're finished with the website so it's time for the advertisement and for that I'm gonna be using a service that kind of scrapes the internet scrapes AliExpress supplier videos videos of the product online into one single video that we can use as an advertisement and that costs 50 bucks I ended up working on the advertisement for a bit on day two day three I got the 50 ad I ordered which here's how that looked like edited some different scroll Stoppers in the beginning uploaded some different variations of it so our skin feel on Tick Tock account and we were pretty much ready to launch step four get your money up not your funny up run up some ads G it's now time to install The Tick Tock pixel on our website which is what will allow Tick Tock to gather data and optimize our advertisements so we'll install it by connecting our Shopify account to our Tick Tock ads account okay so after I press this submit button our ad account will either go into pending which looks like this for like up to two whole days and if that happens we can't really do anything we'll just have to wait it out which is really gonna mess with our time constraint here or it could get approved right away and we can start running ads right now so let's see let's go we're approved from the get-go with this rite of passage from Tick Tock be treasy eagerly hopped on the platform absolutely clapped out 10 different ad sets and launched those suckers straight into the metaverse right so same day here I just got a notification from Tick Tock and our ads are not approved and even worse it's not like oh we don't like this or that about Chad please fix product promoted on the ad landing page belongs to prohibited industry of the targeted location in your app which isn't true you can sell makeup on Tick Tock in the US so when I get home I'm gonna have to submit this for a manual review which can take up to around two days which means our new updated time frame here is after the review they have to approve us that'll bring us to day six meaning the next day day seven we have to do a thousand dollars that day or Busca our schedule couldn't be any tighter they they always say it takes two days for manual review and they're not lying it usually takes exactly two days maybe they can get Stars a little quicker just this time somehow but if not it's a crazy tight schedule here day five Tick Tock said end of day six we finally heard back from the talk but I've been trying to get my circadian rhythm on lock so I was asleep by the time they replied day seven here and we didn't get approved Joanna from Tick Tock says we are basically selling a pharmaceutical product I usually never have an issue where they're this off on why they want to prove an ad but nonetheless I did some pondering and I think they might be confused because I have the ingredients of the serum that is meant to be used with a microcurrent device on the product page here so I'm gonna try to move that section away from our product page and then create some new ad sets and try to launch those because I actually kind of get it from their perspective if there's a bunch of Pharma related ingredients listed on the product page I can see how they might think that it's a pharmaceutical product and sure enough that was actually it with this one swift move our new ads got approved and started running and on day seven at five o'clock in the afternoon about 30 minutes after the ad started delivering and after about a hundred store visitors we just got our first sale and only took like 30 minutes of the store actually running and the ads delivered here let me refresh it for you guys 47.98 we got 124 store sessions and 26 live visitors right now the ads keep running smooth for the end of the day we still have five six seven hours for us to hit our goal I don't know are we about to hit a last second clutch move I will admit the ads have been running a little sporadically but it's 8 44 p.m and we are at 275 but if you look at the last hour we've seen a pretty major spike here so I'm thinking maybe they're just now starting to get dialed in and optimized and we need 700 in sales three hours left it's like 200 an hour I mean it's still possible I still have some hope okay little to be treasy no back this would be his last sale for the day shortly after filming this clip Tick Tock paused all of his ads because according to them he was promoting medicine good okay okay okay okay it's day number eight which means seven days has passed and we didn't hit the goal yesterday first off I'm not giving up last night when Tick Tock paused all of her ads I went back in and removed any and all sassy language from our website so where it said stuff like serum I replaced it with gel just anything that could possibly have a medical or pharmaceutical connotation I replaced those words with synonyms and then instead of waiting two days for a manual review I changed the ending of our URL or link to the product page and then remade all the ad sets but now they're leading to this new product page it's not new and I guess sometime around 4am they got approved and probably started delivering around 6 a.m because it's currently 12 o'clock and we are at 375 dollars in sales I think we got to the root of the problem and everything seems to be running smooth now but it is day number eight you know realistically if we count the days that I was actually working for only on like day five nah I'm kidding I made the stupid cocky little bet and I'd feel bad if I refilmed an intro where we didn't do the challenge or updated it to eight days so let's do the buzz 2 56 pm and we are at 835 it's our first full day of actually running the store and it's looking like it might even be a two thousand dollar day that's Tick Tock ads right now it's crazy now as you guys know I do have a course that I launched about two years ago that was targeted at beginners before it focused on Drop Shipping through Facebook ads and Instagram theme pages but given that as you guys saw hands down the easiest way to get into Drop Shipping right now has to be Tick Tock ads I actually sat down and redid the whole thing from scratch just to update it and it'll now focus on Tick Tock ads but by the time you're watching this video the whole course is completed updated and ready to go so if anyone is interested in taking advantage of this new wave of tick tock drop shipping it'll be linked below where you can find out more information about it or you can go to biaheza.com and I'll redirect you there honestly people saw results with the first version and now with Tick Tock ads and just the fact that this new version is so much better I mean I I think we're gonna see some ridiculous results coming from people enrolled in the course in the coming months like even on some non-sales Vibes I 100 stand by this product and just like that we have our Bittersweet Victory here it's currently 4 30 p.m we've spent a total of 330 dollars on Tick Tock ads and that brought in a total of 22 orders worth 1019 I'll put up the exact math up on the screen but I believe for this first full day of running we're walking away with around 300 profit even if we don't account for the fact that we could start scaling the store and get to like ten thousand dollars per day well actually I don't know don't quote me on that I haven't tested this product before maybe you wouldn't be profitable running at 10 grand per day but I'm sure you can play around with some new ad creatives and the pricing structure of the product and make something worse so in just seven days using a laptop and half of a phone we built up a business that's on track to do six figures and it's very likely that this could be a seven figure business even if you don't buy my course you don't try Tick Tock Drop Shipping I hope this video shows you how realistic it is to actually make money with an online business it might take a few attempts and obstacles on the way but you don't have to be a genius to succeed with it you just kind of have to be persistent anyways we were one day off which means buzz cut I couldn't get the Clipper switch in the bathroom so we're here in the laundry room ah okay Vsauce are you talking to me tell me why I'm looking like I'm on parole in about four four to five states yikes well I hope you guys enjoyed this video and have an amazing grace every day peace

        "text": "[Music] I want to start to buy a failed Million Dollar business and then save by implementing some new strategies it can maybe revive it to its former glory now though this is pretty risky buying any seven-figure business isn't going to be cheap and I could end up losing all of my money the price points for these aren't as crazy and Out Of Reach as you may think so I really want to try this out to see if it could be a shortcut to making a ton of money or if you'd be better off just starting from scratch there's this really neat Marketplace called Shopify exchange where people can sell e-commerce businesses and because this Marketplace is owned by Shopify the listings on here are actually connected to the stores so the sellers can't fake their numbers or provide some phony screenshots and even just scrolling through here can be really interesting even motivating you can see a bunch of these stores that have Revenue numbers in the eight figures balance of stores that have zero revenue and somehow even negative sales maybe from returns or chargebacks or something I don't know and as far as pricing goes the same thing anywhere from 50 bucks to the millions depending on what you want to get okay so my search criteria is going to be one I want to try to find a business that's done over a million dollars in sales two I'm hoping their fairly recent sales I don't want to buy something super outdated and three bring water and Good Vibes that's pretty much it let's hop on the computer [Music] okay I looked through like every listing on this Marketplace a lot of them were just completely unreasonable asking hundreds of thousands of dollars for drop shipping stores from like 2017. just a whole lot of Facebook Marketplace hey buddy I know what I got here type live but I narrowed it down to two really good options may I may I present to you the first option a company called Lenny lemons that's gone over 8 million dollars worth of sales in the last few years eight million it's a company in the baby Niche they want 20 grand for it and it looks like they even have some inventory that'll come with a sale which is 20 grand for a business that's cleared over eight million dollars in sales I feel like that's not bad although a lot of the sales are from a while ago Maya presents you the second option don't buy it I'm out it's a business in the beauty Niche that's done about three and a half million now I really like this one because the sales were as recent as of this year so I feel like we could pretty quickly get that up and running and they're also asking 20 bands so I don't know exactly how this process works but I'll message both of them and get back to you actually never mind you guys know me sneaky fella pumped fake two a little bit whoa I hit up a few other listings as backup and off rip we've just uncovered I don't know if I want to call it a scam but definitely a racket of sorts so this one seller got back to me and basically said hey sorry already sold the store but there's this marketing agency I credit all of my store success to let me know if you want to get in contact with it which is just it's got to be the craziest declined acquisition strategy I've seen from a marketing agency in a long time so this is kind of getting my guard up in terms of scams and kind of letting my hopes down if this is the first response we got this this thing was kind of too good to be true so I'll just check back in when those other two reply [Music] foreign ended up just never getting back to me he probably smelled the incoming lowball offer through my email ahead of time no hard feelings now as far as the three million dollar Beauty conglomerate store owner Stephanie hit me back very quickly which gave me the option to place an offer so I shot for the stars and said 40 off I could do 12 Grand she said nah I'm gonna need 16 I said let me think about it I mean I spent 16 at the ball on a random Tuesday not a big deal obviously but while I was thinking about it we had an unforeseen circumstance it just so happens that right when I sit down to make this video Shopify announces that they're gonna be taking down this Marketplace entirely in like two weeks I kid you not this Banner just pops up out of nowhere I mean last resort there's also another website called Flippo we could use where you could buy the same kind of thing but but I think I'm just gonna try to sneak in here last second and swoop up this beauty conglomerate before The Exchange closes down that way we won't have to leave Shopify and can process this transaction safely and they don't work it was already too late so if we wanted this deal we had to make it happen outside of this safe trusted media but on the plus side me being hesitant made Stephanie drop her price to 14 000 from the original 20 and so at this price I was ready to go through with it the seller set up a deal through escrow.com which I've never personally used before but apparently it's gonna act as a middle party for us so I don't know I'm really about to go transfer 14 000 to a stranger amount on the internet and have never even spoken to and the thing with wire transfers there's no going back once you initiate it there's no way to get a refund oh so we'll see what happens [Music] you know what if I get scammed it'll be good for the plot character development [Music] after initiating the transfer all I could really do was sit back and anxiously wait the escrow service said they received my payment but they took forever processing it they requested over an agreement and were just suspiciously gatekeeping this transaction I just woke up to this email saying that my payment for the escrow has finally been secure so I guess now the ball is officially in the seller scored will they send me this store I don't know at this point it's been like a week since I've sent that payment so I've had the time to come to peace and accept the very real possibility that I might have just got rinsed but we'll see now after getting up that morning running a few marathons reading three books establishing four new uncles and having breakfast an hour later I got an email my eyes couldn't believe things are different now it's not be treasy no more talk to me nice it's Mr Bia has anau owner of multi-million dollar online Beauty conglomerate Avenue this is an email from Shopify inviting me to become the new store owner of this business so I think we might be in or this is a virus malware phishing link and I'm about to have all my accounts squeezed dry and rinsed what's up gentlemen well I'm pleased to announce that it was option one we finally did it I was now the owner of this once thriving e-commerce business I checked the sales on the store and sure enough everything was as advertised except as the new owner I now had a new problem [Music] okay so I just realized that this store has a hundred fifty seven thousand dollars worth of sales that were made this year meaning tax has not yet been paid for the sale so if I as the new owner and as the person who updated the information inside of this store now receive a 1099 tax document saying that this is my income I very well could have just spent fourteen thousand dollars to buy myself an eighty thousand dollar tax bill no no no no we'll talk I can't I don't know if it's true or not I'm about to make some phone calls and figure this out this was and honestly still kind of is quite the scare for me but I email the owner talked to Shopify support and we were eventually able to update the new ownership in the system and then by also creating a new payment processing account we did resolve this issue bruh okay so everything with this sale has now been settled let me show you what we got this is where the Journey Begins being able to look through everything in the store was really cool I found they had a couple half a million dollar months we could see their top selling products which were magnetic eyelashes followed by this mask they recently sold some of this lip gloss that makes your lips bigger fishing hook but the product pages on here were actually fired let's set a goal right now to get the store back up to a thousand dollars per day in Revenue but if we don't hit that goal within two weeks of today you already know the drill I'm shaving my head bald again you know what let's up the stakes I'll also shave my eyebrows actually after going through the website I ended up hopping on a call with the previous owner to get some more info I got to hear Stephanie's story of getting into Drop Shipping after being dissatisfied with her job so I decided to go on YouTube and learn some courses my boyfriend at the time had and then also what I could do to revive it I think she basically said should be through better Tick Tock ads thank you have a good one bye-bye with this we were off I hopped on the computer and got to work day one hour zero I think I want to try to revive this product right here this lip gloss that makes your lips bigger Stephanie sent over a bunch of content she paid for of people using this product so I think I can make some pretty steezy ads with it and this product is also on zendrop which is a software supplier that you can connect right to your Shopify store and they'll process all of your orders and ship them out automatically really quickly and for super cheap I would borderline plug them for free because it's just a great service especially if you're just getting into Drop Shipping I know the order for filament and the shipping times are people's biggest concerns so I'd probably use them either way but Zen drop did throw me a bone to help cover rent after this recent business acquisition so here I am disclosing that they did bless me with a couple dollars but they're honestly great you connect them to your store and they'll process ship out and fulfill all of your orders for you can choose from products they already have on their website or they can even get any product from AliExpress and start processing and shipping it for you this instant lip plumper is gonna cost me about two dollars and then like another four for ship then we're going to turn around and sell it for 20 30 on our website so when people buy from our website Zen drop will automatically fulfill those orders and send this product to our customers and we keep the 20 30 difference as profit I spoke to Jared the founder of zendrop and he said that their average current delivery time is about 11 days which is great for Drop Shipping they even have some product research tools on here so you can find your next winning product through this platform within a few clicks you can even have all of your packages come in with a custom card with your branding on it all through the same platform you no longer have to deal with AliExpress and struggle with language barriers and try to develop your own systems with suppliers from China this does all that for you so feel free to check them out using the link in my description again this is something that I would recommend even outside of this brand so now that we have the back end of our business figured out which took a few clicks on like five minutes thanks to zendrop I'm gonna try to work on this product page a little bit just tweak a few things and then edit some advertisements foreign this was my final product page basically just switched the wording and some images here and there minor stuff like this button it leads you to check out here's a few clips of the new advertisements I remixed really going for that Tick Tock organic non-overly edited Vibe okay I think this looks good I believe it could pop off but now is the real test it's where all this could fall apart if you find out the story's banned from Tick Tock ads if they don't like our products some of our wordings off they don't like our images there could be days of just back and forth let's hope things go smooth and we can get these ads approved and running on Tick Tock right away but it's oftentimes not that simple so I set everything up here all of our ads are now getting reviewed so I'll see you guys in the morning with hopefully some good news about some approved ads good news and bad news here so good news I woke up today God is the greatest weather Tick Tock approved all of our ads no problem things went exceptionally smooth so that was a huge relief the ads started running and as you can see here we even got 173 store visitors up to this point which when I saw that this morning threw me off 173 sessions and zero sales it doesn't really make sense for this funnel there are good ads and this is a great landing page they should at least have a two percent conversion rate so we have these should have gotten like three for sales so then I looked closer at the conversion rate and we had 14 people add this to their cart and 10 reach the checkout but zero actually converted it just really doesn't add up so I went on the store and tried to check out as a customer I went through the whole sales page and once I got to the shipping portion of the checkout process I was met with this message saying I can't have the product delivered to my address just when I realized I didn't look over the shipping settings for this store so I went back in figured all that out and now we are good to go and people can actually purchase from our store but overall things are looking good I'll check back in once we hopefully get some sales soon as I put down the camera look at this we already got our first sale so the shipping was definitely the issue things are looking promising but it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows from here in fact I ended up losing money on ads that first day however I did get a little data from that so I spent a lot of time using it to create better ads since I could kind of see what was working in practice I also experimented with targeting different interests and then played around with a website to try and increase the conversion rate purchase purchase purchase come on let's go can we get another one cow check out check out check out now I was fighting for these sales I spent hours optimizing every aspect of this funnel okay I'm gonna preface this by saying maybe don't go buy a fourteen thousand dollar business if you're just getting into this all we really got was a website and some content we could use for ads which we could have easily built the website for free using Shopify you can get a free trial using the link in my description and also have my paid course link down there which explains how to set everything up pay some people to make a few videos using your product connect your website to zendrop to have the back end sorted and boom for under a thousand you basically have the same exact thing you could probably even do it for under like 500. so I just want to put that out there because this 14 000 shortcut is currently working although it may not be the best way to achieve these results day one we got 149 dollars worth of sales but compared to the amount of sessions we had this wasn't a good number so I really shortened down our landing page to be less wordy and more to the point which did wonders for the conversion rate I also started increasing the budget on the ads that got us the initial sales and almost a little anti-climatic here but even though Ecom and Drop Shipping has been dead for years now we did finish off day two with over a thousand dollars in sales now please stand for the court of profit I was pretty aggressive with the ads right out of the gate so it's not huge but for day two we're talking about 400 in ad spend and 257 and product costs leaving us with about three hundred dollars profit for the day but that profit margin is likely to grow as the ads get more optimized as I use some of that data to create better advertisements and the page gets more social proof so that's pretty good I might actually just change the domain of the store and scale it up for a follow-up video but I hope you enjoyed this one and have an amazing rest of your day peace",

        "description": "Over $150 billion.",
        "text": "Over $150 billion. In three days, that's how much the world's 15 largest cryptocurrencies lost in market value. It's because of the crypto exchange platform FTX, which is behind this token, named FTT. On November 6, the tokens value began to fall, losing more than 80% of its worth in the span of 72 hours. Once seen as a survivor in a struggling market, the fall of FTX has sent shock waves through the cryptocurrency industry. So what went wrong? FTX is the brainchild of Sam Bankman Fried. He's commonly known as SPF on social media. He's been previously hailed as a savior of the crypto industry. You were called to JP Morgan on crypto. You had that father you or did not? It doesn't bother me too much. Bankman Fried founded the quantitative trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. Two years later, he started FTX, an exchange platform for buying or selling cryptocurrencies. Right now, he's the majority owner of both firms. That kind of aroused some skepticism among industry players and traders, investors, stakeholders that there could be some sort of conflict of interest in terms of whether Alameda Research was getting preferential treatment, FTX, vice versa. But the official narrative that SPF gave in the past is that the two companies are separate entities. After its launch, FTX attracted major investments from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. We've raised a few billion dollars over the course of the last couple of years and were profitable business. It grew into the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange for derivatives trading. Celebrities promoted the platform and ads. I'm getting into crypto. With FTX, you're in? It's FTX. It's a safe and easy way to get into crypto. I don't think so. FTX was gaining steam and in the process often tussled with finance. The world's largest crypto exchange by volume. When FTX was getting started, finance invested in FTX and it was one of the crypto exchanges earliest investors. But FTX, as we know, grew really rapidly and became a very substantial rival to finance. As FTX grew in the industry, Bankman freed further his reputation as a crypto savior when digital asset prices collapsed earlier this year. He bailed out firms, bending about a billion dollars. But that image didn't last. On November 2nd, CoinDesk published a report based on a leaked Alameda balance sheet. According to the leaked data, Alameda claimed it had over $14 billion in assets at the end of June. But most of that was FTX's tokens. Alameda CEO Caroline Allison, we did that the balance sheet wasn't complete. Caroline also said, it's financial situation is under control. The company is doing well. However, it seems like the market just didn't really buy that and then traders continue to withdraw from FTX. FTX and Alameda did not respond to a request for comment. Things escalated on November 6th when finance said it would offload hundreds of millions of dollars of FTT. Finance did not respond to a request for comment. The announcement sparked mass withdrawals. That day FTX processed four billion dollars of transactions. Many times the normal amount for a day. Some got backlogged, which sparked demand for more. By November 7th, that number ballooned to $6 billion. On the 8th, a day later, FTX's finances were in crisis. Finance stepped in and said it would buy the company. It seemed like FTX might have solved its liquidity problem. But on the 9th, finance backed out of the non-binding acquisition. The next day, the journal reported that FTX used money from customers to fund risky bets made by Alameda. It's a shocking revelation for a lot of people in the industry, because even though there has been a lot of speculation about FTX and Alameda research being joined at the hip, nobody could have foreseen that SPF was willing to transfer billions of customer funds at the key's crypto exchange to help his crypto trading firm. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are investigating FTX, according to a person familiar with the matter. This is not like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. They take people's money, they borrow against it, it's not much disclosure, and then they trade against their customers. A spokesperson for Justice Department declined to comment. Beckman freed told investors that FTX couldn't cover withdrawals, since its collateral was dropping in value and couldn't be liquidated, according to people familiar with the matter. On the 11th, Beckman freed resigned as CEO, and FTX and Alameda filed for bankruptcy. Afterwards FTX said it was probing a potential hack. More than $370 million worth of crypto funds appeared to be missing, according to crypto analytics firm Elliptic. On the 12th, the journal reported that Alameda and FTX executives knew that FTX had lent its customers money to Alameda. So a lot of retail traders and investors I've talked to are feeling desperate or frustrated the majority of the people in the industry could not have seen this coming because FTX is such a dominant player. The fallout has led other companies to tout their reserves and call for more transparency in the industry. As of November 11th, according to the bankruptcy filing, FTX's estimation of their liabilities would make it the largest crypto-related bankruptcy ever filed.",

        "text": "No. No cool intro, no fancy music. I just want to explain inflation in six minutes. I have a degree in economics. I spent years trying to understand this. So let's see if I can boil it down. What is inflation? Why is it rising? Why are people worried? And what do interest rates have to do with it? Federal Reserve is raising the interest rate to raise interest waste inflation in 40 years. Listen, I know that I make long videos. I mentioned nuance. I'm into backstory. Well, this isn't that. This is quick. No, really, this is quick. Let's go. Wait, wait, wait. Rewind. Hold on one second. Before we start the timer, I need to tell you that I was going to do an ad read in the middle of the explanation. Like I was going to stop the explanation and do an ad read. But I realized I want this to be an uninterrupted six minute explanation. So I'll even take out the YouTube ads that are on it so that it can be uninterrupted. But for now, I need to think today's sponsor because it's literally my job. It's how I get paid. Thank you, better help for supporting this video and my channel, generally.

Okay, the ad is over. Let's start the clock up again and see if I can do this explanation in six minutes. Here we go. Okay, first up, the simplest definition. Inflation is when there is more money in the economy than stuff to spend it on. But if you're like me, the simplest definition never does it for you. So let's try this. Imagine a village that has one market where people buy all of their stuff, their food, their clothes. But one day the government shows up because they're worried about the economy of this village. So they tell the people that if they wanna take out a loan and they're gonna make sure that the banks will not charge them a high interest rate. They want to encourage the people to take out loans and spend money. Oh, and they also drop off a giant pile of cash for everyone in the village. And everyone in the village is like, so cute. I'm feeling pretty rich. Villagers now are going to their market and they're buying way more stuff. Many of them have been eyeing the fancy electric bike in the market that before they couldn't justify it. But now they totally can because they have all this new money. The store owner's like sweet. This is great for business. But he's running out of bikes. In fact, he's running out of everything because now all of these people have extra money and they're buying way more than they used to. The store owner's like, I can't keep up with all this demand. I should raise prices and that is inflation. But the village is all of us and the market is the entire economy. When there's extra money floating around and people wanna spend it faster than businesses can make stuff then all of the businesses in all of the industries raise their prices and that is inflation. It's a natural part of the economy. It's kind of a good thing in small doses because it means that the economy is growing and it's why movie tickets used to be 25 cents and now they're like $15. And slowly over time it's fine. Okay, let's go back to the village and see what happens if we keep going at this rate. The store owner has no double his prices on bikes. The interest rate is super low so he takes out a loan to build a new factory to make bikes. This is good. He's growing a business but the government money eventually runs out and his prices are still double. But now the store owner has no one to come by all of his new bikes. And now he has this factory and more employees but no customers. He has to shut down the factory, lay off everyone and slowly start lowering his prices. This is called recession. When COVID shut down the world, governments gave us money, free money. They're like, don't panic and hoard all your money. Instead spend and borrow and keep the economy going. Here in the US they literally sent us $3,200 checks. They gave $600 a week to people who were unemployed for months and months and months. They gave subsidies to people with kids. They increased spending on food stamps, I mean trillions and trillions of dollars of stimulus money. This was vital aid to people in need. But even people who didn't lose a job got a check in the mail. It was free money for everyone and we spent it. I just picked up myself a new bike to manage up across the country. It's time to grind, Paul Tahn. We all just got these big checks from the government. During a pandemic we're like, YOLO, I'm buying a boat or a peloton or whatever. Pokemon cards. There's Netflix for a new motor. Calaton. It's so good. A hot animal crossing. Push it out a little bit. No, don't you dare. But pair all this new spending with the fact that the pandemic also made it harder for factories and ships and retailers to get us all this stuff. Supply chain is. Global supply chain. Supply chain. Supply chain. Now you have an economy where people have way more money than normal and they're ready to spend it. But the economy can't get them stuff fast enough. So what do businesses do with all this insane new demand? They raise prices all at the same time and that is inflation. I feel like we're getting this at this point. But what do interest rates have to do with all this? Raising the interest rate. Interest rate. Or the Fed. Fed, if had to roll a reserve. The Federal Reserve. Most countries have a central bank. The puppet master of the economy. The bank of all banks for that country. But it's not like a normal bank that stores our money and then lends it out and collects interest to make profit. That's what a normal private bank does. The central bank, which we call the Fed here in the US, is run by the government. So their job is to set the rules or policies that all the other banks have to follow. And the central bank is it motivated by profit. But rather, their job is to babysit the economy, to keep it growing, to make sure people have jobs, to make sure that prices don't fluctuate too much so that we can keep growing nicely. No slowdown, no recession. That is what the Fed is there for. But seriously, the Fed is like a puppet master and we're the puppets and it's kind of creepy. They pull strings in the economy to get us to spend our money in a certain way. Which in turn affects how much businesses raise or drop their prices. And guess what, it totally works. One of the strings that they have to pull in the economy is called the interest rate. Wanna borrow money to buy a car or a house or expand your business? You're gonna be way more likely to do that if you only have to pay 2% interest on that loan as opposed to like 6%. Lower interest rates equal people and businesses wanna borrow and spend money. So during the pandemic, the central bank was like, we need everyone to spend money. So they lowered the interest rate. And people borrowed and people spent and it totally worked. We're like freaking puppets. So a low interest rate helps simulate the economy. But once again, we're in this same place where there's now too much money to borrow and spend and not enough goods and services to spend it on. So what do businesses do all at the same time? They raise prices to meet all this new demand, all at the same time. And now your money is worth less and that is inflation. Home prices rising at their highest rate. It's a local bidding war. I'm not going up. By nearly 24%. So that's what's happening right now. All the prices are rising kind of at the same time. What that means is that your $100 bill is now worth 8% less than it was last year. Like the same money is worth less because your purchasing power just got diluted. And the magic that keeps happening, like instead of 8% it's 50%. Now your $100 bill is worth what $50 used to be. And that's what people start to freak out. And our economy that's built on human psychology starts to falter and we fall into a recession or a depression even if it gets real bad. Which is exactly what the Fed is built to avoid. So they're back to pulling their strings and they've started raising rates. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve taking action to try and curb rising inflation. They're gently raising the interest rate to cool down all of this hardcore spending in borrowing. See if they can steer the shit back on course. And let's hope it works. Okay, did we do it? Did we do, did we do it in the time period that I promised I would? We'll find out. Okay. Last thing I want to say is a thing that didn't make it into my little inflation explainer. But a few years ago when I worked at Vox, I went to Venezuela and Columbia to do a borders series. I saw inflation up close and personal because in Venezuela, inflation got so out of control and they couldn't, the Fed, the puppet master couldn't like figure out how to get it back in control. That their money became worth nothing. The prices went up so high that their money became basically worthless. You needed like a pile of cash to buy bread. So what they started doing is they started using the currency itself to make things. Like I visited the sky on the street who was making like purses and bags and like sculptures out of cash because it was worth more as a raw material than it was as like money as a currency, which is insane. That's a very extreme version of inflation. It's happened in several countries that have done this. We're not in that situation even close to that situation, but it's an example of just how tenuous modern economies are. They're not like pegged to gold or whatever. They're like pegged to a bunch of humans believing that this stuff is worth something and it can quickly go off the rails. So I thought I'd share that little fun thing that is more documented in the Vox borders episode that you can go watch on the Vox YouTube channel. So that's all I've got. Thank you all for being here. And I think you should check out if you want to color your videos or your photos. I have lots and presets that you can use to color correct your stuff. I also have a storytelling course on bright trip where I talk about my methodology for visual storytelling with Nathaniel Drew. I think that's sort of it. All the plugs I should do at the end of these videos. But yeah, lots more to come. We're working on lots of amazing videos and I'm really excited to share them. So I'll see you in the next one. Bye everyone. Okay.",

        "description": "Recently I've been getting a bunch of comments saying that I look like Joe from you.",
        "text": "Recently I've been getting a bunch of comments saying that I look like Joe from you. So I thought, well, Joe recommends a bunch of books. I like reading books. Why don't I read the books that he recommends and see if we think alike too. Kind of wish that Joe recommended some like... 50 pages, you know? This is what I'm talking about. This is what we wanted from Joe. Flatlanded. You know, a beautiful little guy. What do you need a thousand pages for Don Key-Hody? We add that all up. Just about 3,000 pages that I've been trying on reading in nine days. It feels like a lot. Not to mention, he recommends a Stephen King. So I picked up the audiobook on Audible called Sleeping Beauties. That's 25 hours long and listening at 1.5 times speed. It works out to just under two hours a day. So in total, we're going to be looking at about an 8 hour a day commitment, which is a full-time job. Seems doable. Started Don Key-Hody. It is fantastic. I am actually excited that there are a thousand pages, which I didn't like I thought is going to be a bit of a slog. I am pumped for this. So I'll probably get to a couple hundred pages before I call it a night. Tomorrow, hope to do the same, except read a little bit more because I'm not starting in the night. I'm starting in the morning. Okay, so 11am now. I've probably been reading 75, 80 minutes. So yeah, 300 pages deep into a thousand there. 30% done. See how far we can get today in that. I don't know. We'll see. Okay, so end of day one, audiobook we're down to, well, I'm through seven hours, 22 minutes and 50 seconds. Putting us in chapter 12. With Don Key-Hody, we got today from page, I think, 204 to page 700. I don't know if you can see that. It sounds about 500 pages of reading by did about nine hours of reading. You know, I actually have things to do with my life tomorrow in this weekend. I'm not just sitting around reading, but this should be the head start that we need to get this done in the next week. So feeling pretty good about day one. Okay, it's a little bit late, but I wrapped up Don Key-Sotay and it was fantastic. I have to say it's my favorite fictional book I've ever read. It is Monday today. I lost a little bit of the weekend to not reading. So we're a little bit behind, but all is not lost. We'll wake up tomorrow and we'll move on to the three musketeers, retiring Don Key-Sotay. All right, so just like that, done the second book, the second most voluminous book as well, the three musketeers, Alexander Dumont. It's really good. It wasn't as good in my opinion as Don Key-Sotay. It's kind of hard to tell what is established now as my favorite piece of fiction of all time. But it was a nice story, nevertheless. Halfway done in terms of page count, which is great. I'm way over halfway done in terms of day count, but hey, you know what, that is what it is. It's like 7pm now. I think I can get a solid five hours in. I can get probably 300 plus pages down of this. You know that tomorrow morning I can wrap this, crush this, and then we'll have an entire day to get through weathering heights. I say that like a day is a long time. So the last time we talked, I think, was 7pm. And I just started the kind of funny Chris, though. It is now 2.30am. And I am done the kind of funny Chris, though. I couldn't put it down. I was one of those stories that just absolutely reels you in, and there is no point at which you will be satisfied stopping. It also helped that my neighbors upstairs were throwing a party, so I actually probably wouldn't have slept anyways. We're making good progress. 3.5 hours of reading today. Almost 1,000 pages. Call me a bookworm, I guess. I don't know. I feel like a kid. I feel like one of the, like, when I was a kid in summer, I would, I remember going to the library and just getting all sorts of novels. And I would really, like, hardy boys, stuff like that. And I would just binge through them. And I could read, you know, multiple novels in a day for sure. And I would stay up late reading. And I don't know. The last time I've done that, and maybe it's been like a decade. Okay. So I'm going to grab some sleep. And then tomorrow we'll hit Master Margarita. Maybe get some weathering heights done. All right. It's about 5.45pm here. I'm a few hours of reading deep into the Master in Margarita. It's a bit of a slower read when I say I'm a few hours in. I'm like five hours in. And I'm on page 266. We just finished book one of two, presumably. All right. So there's now 9pm. And I've done the Master in Margarita, although to say that I'm done is a bit of a, it's a bit of a lie. I mean, I finished the book. I was reading her view that was talking about this. And how hard it is to kind of put into justice. All of the things that this book touches upon and all of the layers of this book. You could sit here and read it with one lens or another lens or another lens. And I think every time you read it through, you would have a bit of a deeper understanding. I'm trying my best not to skim these books. I really, truly am. Not, you know, just, you know, trying to get a cursory glance on the basic understanding. I just read the smart notes if I want to do that, right? Like I'm dedicating many hours to these books. I was, you know, nine hours straight there reading the Master in Margarita. I'm assuming whethering heights will be a similar length. I'm a head to bed. I'm, I'm fried from that book. That book has done a number on me. I have some work to do tomorrow. So I probably won't be reading until the evening. So it seems like we're going to be dedicating our evening tomorrow, weathering heights and then, uh, call me quits. I'm a little tired today. I don't know if you can tell. Um, little bit, a little bit drained. I think for the past few days of reading. Nevertheless, you're seeing this. I made it through. Okay, it is disgustingly late, but we are done weathering heights. And thus the challenge is complete. I have now read all of the books that Joe recommended a few brief words about weathering heights. I thought that it was fantastic. It differentiated itself from the other novels that I read for this challenge and that it was the most realistic. The characters are most like people who I know in real life. The villain who I think, by the way, is one of the great villains in literature. At least the literature that I've read. Heathcliff. Such a good villain. I think it's fantastic. I'll really, really. So just like the, the challenge is complete. And I thought, okay, let's, let's take a little reflection. Let's see, let's see where we've come. The very first book. Don Quisote. I think what, what was so compelling to me about this was that it's just what seems to be a never ending adventure. Although it does have an end in a, you know, solid, a final end at that. It's just a story that you can lose yourself in. And I think that's what I try to fiction for a lot of the time is, it's like an escape. It's another world. And I think that that is, I guess that is a context that Joe recommended Don Quisote. And it is true. It is a perfect escape. It's whimsical, it's tongue in cheek. It's brilliant. It is fantastic. So the second book that I read, the three musketeers, Duma. I think Joe lent it to Paco kind of in a context of, you know, it's a good book. That it is. It's a good book. I wouldn't say, you know, touched on anything very, very deep. This is entertaining. It's highly entertaining. You know, I liked it. Characters are fantastic. Not complex, but wonderful, right? And I think that's exactly what it is. You know, it's, it's fast paced. It's nice, it's accessible. It's a great book. I did not like it as much as the other Duma that Joe recommended, the count of money, Christo. I thought this was fantastic. And now this is lent by Joe to Paco talking about revenge, if I recall correctly. And that's the entire book. And it's, you know, 500 pages of just vengeance slowly being extracted. It was one that I couldn't put down. So the next book was the book that Joe gave to Ellie in season two. And this is the master in Margarita. Like I said, there are just so many layers to it. It's a little hard to unpack. I'm going to have to read it again. It's funny, you know, the characters are great to fantastical worlds. I like it. I like it a lot. But I think it's something which I could love if I, if I read it differently. So I plan on doing that. Absolutely. All right. And finally, this brings us to weathering heights, which I just wrapped up maybe 10, 15 minutes ago. I think what's super interesting about this spoiler alert a little bit is that Joe is very similar to Heathcliff. They actually share a lot of the same characteristics as villains. There's discrepancies for sure. It's not, you know, carbon copy. But you see this character who makes decisions that you can understand out of love and out of frustration with that love. That there are decisions which you, though you understand them, can't justify. So then finally, we have the audiobook sleeping beauties. And I think it's a little bit harder to tie this one to you beyond the simple fact that the premise of the novel is a world where women fall asleep, they're cocooned and they essentially disappear. And I think what I saw when I was researching this and looking at the books, what people are pointing to is that while the women in Joe's life disappear, that being said, fantastic audiobook. Talk more about that in a minute. So overall, very successful challenge. I am so pleased that I did this. I've been introduced to some of my favorite works of fiction of all time. So Joe, thank you for the great recommendations. Please don't kill me. I'd now like to thank Audible for sponsoring this video. I have used Audible almost every day for the past year and a half. And I use it when I'm doing so many different things, when I'm walking, commuting, when I'm cooking, when I'm in the gym, listen to audiobooks a ton through Audible and it has been a fantastic service for me. Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks out there. And beyond that, they've now got Audible originals, which are original pieces of audio content produced by Audible. And the audiobook that I'm going to recommend to you now should come as no surprise after watching this video. It's Sleeping Beauties by Stephen King and Owen King. And it's read by Marin Ireland who does a fantastic job. And I think one of the cool things about this audiobook is that there's actually a conversation with the authors included. So you get a little bit of extra content beyond the audiobook itself. So if you want to check out Sleeping Beauties or any other audiobook in Audible's massive collection, then what I'll recommend you do is go to audible.com slash John Fish or text who John Fish to 500, 500. So I'll get you a 30 day free trial, including one free audiobook and two pieces of Audible original content. That's all for free. If you go to audible.com slash John Fish or text code John Fish to 500, 500. So thank you so much for watching. Thank you for sticking with me. Hopefully I'm not too out of it right now. It's hard to tell. I realized this past week, what a privilege it is that I can kind of push work to the side and say, okay, this week I'm just going to read. I understand that's a tremendous privilege. And it is because of you guys on the internet that I have that privilege. So thank you. I appreciate it. If you did enjoy the video, feel free to like it, leave a comment, subscribe. It helps a lot with the algorithm. If you do these things according to Graham, Steven, I don't know. It also just feeds my ego. Okay, I spent a lot of hours reading. I would like it if you justify that. Okay, this is worth it in itself. Okay. Thank you for watching. I appreciate you and I'll see.",

        "text": "my dad was kind of a funny guy he used to always put like anything into a salad and because it was put into a salad it was healthy so it got to the point like at some point where he started putting like everything putting lasagna in his salad and because he was putting into the salad it was healthy it was a salad well I guess I kind of take after him because I'm gonna tell you some stuff to put in your post-workout drink I have ten other videos talking about putting greens in your post-workout drink all these things like if it's a post-workout drink it's gonna be healthy right well okay I'm actually talking about matcha green tea in this video and yes I really do want you put in your post-workout drink but I want to talk a little bit more about kind of the benefits of matcha in general all right so we know that tea has a lot of health benefits like Eastern culture has touted it as one of the best kind of things that you can do for your overall health by and large and now Western culture is really picking up on that especially in the last maybe half a century or so but green tea sort of leads that in being the healthiest right I mean we always hear green teas the best well taking it one step further we look at matcha and all matcha tea is is really just pulverized green tea but green tea gets its benefits from something that are called catechins and these catechins are what give you all the benefits I mean they're really what makes tea healthy so when you look at a polarized version of tea a pulverized version of these leaves it allows for greater absorption now there is a 2003 study by chromatography that found that when you actually pulverized green tea that it increased the catechins by 137 times that's like off-the-charts so the catechins are the good components of teas then obviously a pulverized version of them is going to be markedly better and we're gonna get a lot more the benefits out of those now the catechins of course as I said they're the components that give tea the benefits okay there's a lot of bio regulatory activities that tea helps that are just amazing like it's an antimicrobial its antioxidant it's an anti-inflammatory then it also helps lower blood pressure helps lower your cortisol levels it can lower your cholesterol and then additionally now it's being shown to help out your healthy gut flora so it helps increase the ratio of good gut flora to bad gut flora pretty darn remarkable now a lot of the positive benefits of green tea in general come from something called epic gallo catechin three gaily yes that is a huge mouthful but you've know it as EGCG okay remember all those infomercials always talking about EGCG it's like this amazing super miracle thing when all it is they're just trying to sell you some product that probably call a cost them like 30 cents to make EGCG is just the type of catechin that is most prevalent in green tea and helps mobilize fat now you can get a lot more out of that epic gala catechin three gay late if you just have a polarized version of green tea which we're talking about matcha here so in a 2011 study in Saito technology it was found that a pulverized version of green tea so ultimately matcha increased the absorption of those catechins specifically EGCG by 2x okay so we already know that pulverizing green tea in the first place from that 2003 study we know that increases the availability of catechins by 137 times but now we know what this 2011 study the nones pulverized our body actually absorbs two times the amount so double whammy if it's pulverized not only do we have more catechins more EGCG but we also are actually utilizing those catechins in the epic gala catechin 3 gala so pretty amazing stuff right then in there now that same study looked at plasma levels what we're actually utilizing what we're actually absorbing when it comes to this amazing green tea stuff ok there are two kinds of catechins that we've got we've got ester catechins and we've got three type catechins when you drink a cup of green tea your body can assimilate and utilize those freetype catechins relatively easily that's why you're getting the benefits of EGCG even when you drink a cup of green tea but those s their catechins we don't really absorb them much with just standard tea they don't really become available for utilization until the tea's been polarized and here's the cool thing the finer the pulverization the more that it's pulverized the finer that the matcha tea is the more the absorption so the finer the tea the higher the quality now granted you're going to pay more for a high quality matcha tea but at the end of the day considering how quickly it absorbs and how much you can utilize you're better off spending a couple more bucks in getting more gram gram you would buy buying a cheap say grittier type of matcha a high quality matcha should be like the consistency of eyeshadow or maybe like baby powder very very fine almost to the point where you could throw it up and be in a magical cloud of it if you want it to be okay now here's a little tip too so now I talked about turmeric all the time and how black pepper can help increase the bioavailability of it you can utilize it more well same thing applies with that EGCG so when you have more epic aloe catechin 3 Gaelic that's available but then you also have black pepper that can increase the absorption then BAM you've got a massive absorption of green tea now I recommend throwing this in your post-workout shake get the fat mobilization effects of it that EGCG is huge on fat mobilization it's huge on antioxidant effects and it's huge on promoting a healthy metabolism so get it when your body's going to utilize the most add it to your post-workout drink add just even a teaspoon or two teaspoons of high-quality finely pulverized matcha and get that benefit and get that EGCG and make the most out of your day as always keep it locked in here my videos and I will see you in the next one",

        "text": "OK, so you're here to audition for a part in the British Airways Safety Information video. Can you just look into the camera and give your name please? Hi, I'm Cho Atalagio for. Have you done any safety videos before? No. Only feature films. Well, this could be your big break, OK, mate? So don't mess it up. Shall we get one of the guys? Now listen to your tell. There's going to be an auto queue, so you don't have to learn the lines. You just read them. OK, focus. OK, action. Hello. We will now demonstrate the safety features on this aircraft. And your attention is essential, as these may differ from any aircraft that you've flown on before. Mmm, bit of a show off. Take care of your handbag. It does not block the aisles or exit. It must be put under the seat in front of you, or in an overhead locker. Place items in the locker, carefully as they may fall out, and injure someone, especially if it's a bag full of duty-free goods darling. Actually, sorry, that was meant for Joanna Longley. Muppet. Sorry. In the case of an evacuation, you must move quickly to the closest usable exit, taking absolutely nothing with you. And I mean nothing sweetie. Yeah, that's the one of her lines. F*** me. You. Sorry, action. All exits are clearly marked, and are being pointed out to you now. Please take a moment to locate your nearest exit, bearing in mind this may be behind you. Well, that was beautiful. Thanks. I'm not seriously that bit about the nearest exits. Really powerful. Please, carry on, Fandy. Tandy. Tandy. Say. Opening the doors automatically inflates the evacuation slides. And remember, high-heeled shoes must be taken off as they may tear the slide. Oh, no way. Design the shoes like me. I mean, it's so like soul mate. We should hang. Good. If the cabin air supply fails, oxygen will be provided. Masks like this will appear automatically. Stand your seat and pull the mask towards you. Place the mask over your mask and nose like this, and breathe normally, adjusting the band to secure it. Please note that the bag may not inflate. In all the washrooms, cup-world and first cabins, you may need to pull on the coloured streamer to release the mask. And please, please do make sure your own mask is fitted before helping anyone else. That was so wonderful. You think you'll get the purse? You think so, I hope so. Next. Right. Pay attention, please. Your life jacket is underneath or beside your seat, if required. Please remove the jacket from its container and pull it over your head. Pass the tapes around your waist and tie them securely in a double bow at the side. And thus, a double bow. To inflate, pull the red toggle as show. When you see a red toggle, that's definitely the toggle to tug. Now, the air in this rather wonderful jacket can be topped up by using this neat little mouthpiece. There's also a charming whistle and light combination for attracting attention. Should you be one of those people who enjoys attention. And please, fairly obviously, do not inflate your lovely life jacket until you've actually left the aircraft. At which point, toggle up, inflate away and whistle all you like. Okay, so Jim, I'll read the line and then when I do the nod, you do the action. Okay. Please now ensure that your seat is upright and in the take of position with armrest down. Your footstool and video screen are stored if you have them and your table is folded away. Genius. Look, I got goosebumps. Is that it? Just the tray table? That's it. And you smashed it. What's with it? I've never certainly said it quite. Thank you. In the unlikely event of the aircraft having to make an emergency landing, you will be told to adopt this protective brace position. If facing rearwards in club world, you must adopt this position. If you have any questions, please ask your cabin crew. Great, very intense. I love the sound face. Maybe we could try the next bit just a little less serious. Less serious. Just chill out, maybe if you just move your head, actually. No, that's fine. You got it. Exactly. So we can see the beautiful smile. Very radiant. But it's not X-file. There's no alien in there. Good. Just chill out, yeah? Thank you. Brilliant. Thank you, Julian. Action. You'll also find the Flying Start donation envelope in your seat area. So if you've got any spare change in any currency, find it, take it out and put it in the envelope. Please. Spot on. Deb, that's a wrap. On behalf of British Airways, Comic Relief and Flying Start. Thank you for your attention and your kind donations. Every penny of which will help children all over the world. Living really tough lives. If you have any questions or you can't find your safety card. Or flying start envelope. Please ask one of your gorgeous cabin crew members. Have an enjoyable flight. Thank you.",

        "text": "Part of this video is sponsored by LastPass.\nMore about LastPass at the end of the show. This is a video about research into slowing the rate of aging and extending the human lifespan. So, before I filmed this I wanted to know: What do you guys generally think about such research? And I made a Twitter poll where I found that the majority of people were supportive and thought there should be more of it but there were some important concerns and I want to address those here at the beginning. I mean the most significant concern was: if we're looking to extend human lifespan, does that just mean we'll have more sick years where we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's?\nNobody wants that, and that was clear to me. But the professor that I was interviewing for this video, professor David Sinclair, points out that as you get older the risk of horrible diseases, things like diabetes and cancer, and arthritis, all those sorts of things... it increases exponentially. And so, if this research is successful the whole point of it will be to forestall those sorts of diseases. I mean, if you really are tackling aging, then you should also see that those age-related diseases do not set in so quickly. So, the point of slowing aging and extending human lifespan is to extend the healthy lifespan, also called the health span. The other concerns I saw were that people were saying: \"Well, this could be used only for the wealthy and increase inequality\" or \"It could increase the population of the Earth causing...\" \"...more garbage, more CO2. Where are the resources to feed all these people?\". I think these are valid concerns, but they're not part of the scope of this video. So if you want to discuss them in the comments, feel free, but the point of this video is to address: can we slow aging in humans? Can we extend the lifespan and the health span? And what does that look like? How do we do it? Okay. So for this video I traveled up to the 'Bodega Marine Lab', which is north of San Francisco and there I got to see some 'moon jellyfish'. Now what's fascinating about these 'moon jellyfishes' is that some people consider them immortal. How can that be? So all these jellyfish have this complex life cycle where they start off as a polyp, which is basically like a small sea anemone and then they'll go through a metamorphosis and become a medusa. And the medusa stage is what we generally think of when we think about a jellyfish. And in most of these species the polyps are generally able to asexually reproduce, and they can regenerate if tissue is cut off of them or if they're damaged, and they don't have any clear evidence of senescence, which is the term for biological aging. So they appear to have some degree of immortality. No one had reported their ability to do this until... I think this was 2015. So do 'moon jellyfish' hold the key to slowing aging and extending our lifespan? Could they help us live forever? Before I got into making this video, I would have put this sort of research in the same category as downloading your brain, your consciousness into a computer. Like, I can see how maybe that would work but I don't think we're anywhere near that. Because we don't even understand how the brain works or how memories are stored, so that seems like serious science fiction, so I would have put, say, extending the human lifespan to 120, 150, and beyond in the same category, but after reading professor Sinclair's book and doing an interview with him, I think it seems much more possible and in fact plausible that we'll make some progress over controlling aging in our lifetimes. Now, if you want to slow aging, the first question you need to answer is: Why do we age in the first place? I mean, what really is aging? I've made a video in the past about telomeres. These are the end caps on your chromosomes. And every time a cell divides the telomere gets a bit shorter. So it was thought that these telomeres are kind of like the tips of your shoelaces and they prevent the chromosome from fraying. But there are other signs in older bodies that you have old cells. There are an accumulation of things, they're called senescent cells. They're essentially these zombie-like cells that just go on living in your body and inflaming the cells around them. There's poor intercellular communication, there's mitochondrial dysfunction, those are the powerhouses of the cell. There are these 8 or 9 different features of older cells and they are the hallmarks of aging. But the question is: are they the cause of aging, or are they kind of the result of a deeper root cause? In the middle of the last century, the hypothesis was that it was damage to our DNA, mutations to our DNA that happened over  the course of our lives that led us to be older But, evidence since then has suggested that that is not really the case. I mean, you can take an adult cell, and you can clone it into a new organism. And that organism appears to live about as long as non-cloned organisms of the same species. Now, the first sheep, Dolly the sheep, had a short lifespan. She died early. But cloned animals; you can now clone a monkey, you can clone dogs, in fact Barbra Streisand, the actress, she cloned her dogs, and they are expected to live a normal lifespan. So in that way it seems like all the information is still there in the DNA. So if we're not losing information in our DNA then what is the reason for aging? Well, professor Sinclair suspects that it's a loss of information, but not the information in our DNA, in our genome. No, professor Sinclair suspects that the loss of information is in our epigenome. So what is the epigenome? Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but, different cell types have different epigenomes. They have different ways of packaging that DNA, coiling up, you know, a lot of it so that it's not read, and leaving some parts of the DNA spooled out, so it's easier to transcribe and turn into proteins and run that cell. So the epigenome is responsible for turning on or turning off different parts of the DNA. The way it does that is with proteins called 'histones' that, essentially, the DNA is wrapped on, and also things like methylation. So there's these chemical signaling markers which are placed on the DNA in certain positions. So the idea is: when your body is first forming, the epigenome is what tells your cells what type of cell to be. But as you get older, professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that we are losing information in the epigenome. And that's important because if a skin cell needs to remain a skin cell, that's the epigenome. And if you don't have the epigenome the skin cell will forget what type of cell it is and it might turn into a brain cell, which may not be that bad but if your brain turns into a skin cell you've got a problem and I think that's largely what aging is. I've gotta say, there's some weird, hair patches, on my shoulder, that have happened as I've gotten older. Is that a cell... doing the wrong thing?\nAre those meant to be skin cells? Are they're screwing up or is this just some... I don't know. No, no, weird stuff happens when you get older, right?\nYou start to get hair growing where it shouldn't: ears, nose, back.\nThat's cells losing their identity, the cells go: \"I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, I'm not reading the right genes anymore.\" So, the key to this sort of breakdown in the epigenome is DNA damage? Yeah, so when you go out in the sun, not like today, but on a day where there's a lot of sun, you'll break your chromosomes. And in the effort that the cells go to to stick the chromosome back together, note: the DNA isn't just flailing around, it's actually bundled up. The cell has to unwrap it, recruit proteins to help, join it together, and then they have to go back and reset the structures. And that resetting of the epigenome happens about 99%. That 1% is the aging process. So overtime, histones are not returned to the right places and DNA methylation is added in places where it shouldn't be. We can read that methylation pattern and I could tell you how old you are, exactly, and when you're even gonna die. How could you tell that? Well, it's a clock, we call it the Horvath clock named after my good friend Steve Horvath, and so these little chemicals that accumulate on the DNA like a plaque on the teeth, we can read that and the more you have, the older you are; biologically. So you might only be 40, you're younger than 40, of course but, you know, I'm 50 now, but I might be biologically 60, actually I was. And I changed my life and then the test said I was biologically 31. I mean, one of the things I found really interesting was: you found a way to make mice age faster. So, how did you do that? Well, the clock of aging is due to the loss of the information in the cell, and one way to accelerate that is to go break a chromosome. Instead of going in the sun we engineered a mouse where we could break its chromosomes. Not enough to cause mutations, the cells put the DNA back together, so we didn't lose any genetic information. But if we're right about the 'epigenetic information theory of aging', those mice should get old and that's exactly what happened. It's gray, it's got a hunchback, it's got dementia, all its organs look old, but the real test was: \"what if we measured that DNA clock?\" what we call the 'DNA methylation clock'. And we measured it and those mice were actually 50% older than mice that we didn't treat. So that isn't just a mouse that looks old, that mouse literally is older. What's interesting about this hypothesis is that, if it's true, if the noise accumulating the epigenome is really what's causing aging, well then there are steps we can take right now to slow the rate of aging in our bodies, by trying to better maintain our epigenomes. So how do we do that? There's this theory, that billions of years ago early bacteria took an important evolutionary step. They actually developed two different modes of living. When times were good they used their energy to grow and reproduce. But when conditions were tough, they used their energy to protect and repair their cells. They evolved, what professor Sinclair calls: 'longevity genes'. These genes triggered by adversity create enzymes which among other things, maintain the epigenome. And today, those same longevity genes can be found in bacteria, and us. We have these 'hormetic response' genes or 'longevity genes' that are in all of our cells, and they sense when we've run a lot, we've lost our breath or we're hungry, we are a little bit hot, or a little bit cold. These genes are turning on our general defenses against aging. So, what is that? So, parts of our cells fall apart: they can put them back together. Proteins misfold: they can get rid of them or put them back together. The ends of the chromosomes get shorter: they can lengthen them. A lot of processes that go on but one of the most important, I think, is maintaining the information, the epigenetic information in the cell, so that our cells don't forget what to do. There are three types of longevity gene. There are the ones we work on called 'sirtuins' and they control the information in the cell. In fact, 'sir' in sirtuin stands for 'silent information regulator' number two (SIR2). There are other ones. The other group is called AMP-kinase or AMPK. This group of genes senses how much energy we're taking in... mostly in the form of sugar. And then the third group is called mTOR. And these genes control and respond to how much amino acids we're taking in. So if you eat a giant steak, you've got a lot of amino acids coming into your body. That'll actually prevent mTOR from hunkering down and keeping you being longer lived. So the mouse experiments actually bear this out. The best way to make a mouse live longer is to reduce the amount of time it eats, so periodic fasting, intermittent fasting, to keep it a little bit cool, and to restrict its amino acids. That's the recipe for long life for a mouse, and it's true for monkeys as well, that have been calorie restricted studies where these monkeys for 15 years didn't eat as much food as the ones that gorged themselves whenever they wanted. And they were protected. They didn't just age slower. They didn't get as much diabetes and heart disease, they were actually fit and healthy, when the control group, eating whatever they wanted, aged and became sick quicker. When some people think about eating less, like, calorie restriction as a way to extend their life. That doesn't seem like a very pleasant way to extend life. I mean, to be hungry for longer... So are there other ways to... you know, mimic that effect? Or to simulate that? There are these molecules that turn on the sirtuin pathway, and trick the body. And so, for example, in the lab if I give some of our mice a molecule called 'NMN', which raises the level of a chemical called 'NAD', you get hyperactive defenses in the body. And what did you see in these... 'senescent mice' that you gave NMN to? Well, we had a bit of an incident. These mice that we gave NMN to ran 50% further, but actually some of them ran so far that the machine, the little treadmill, stopped working. And we had to reprogram the software because this program had never seen a mouse that ran more than three kilometers. Three kilometers for a mouse? For an old mouse. They outran the young mice. And that's like an ultramarathon for us? That would be probably like taking a 70 year-old and making them run faster than a 20 year-old; further. Yes, so these are ultra marathoners, and if we did that to humans I imagine you could have 90 year-olds winning Olympic medals. So to sum up, there are six things that you can do right now to slow the rate of your aging. Starting with zero: avoid DNA damage. Wear sunscreen, avoid x-rays and all that sort of stuff. Number one: eat less. Caloric restriction. Number two: eat less protein, because your body has ways of detecting how much of that you're taking in. Number three: do some exercise.\n'High-intensity interval training' (HIIT). Get your heart rate up to 85%, make your body feel like you're running from a lion or something. Number four: be uncomfortably cold, or number five: be uncomfortably hot. All of these things will trigger your body's 'longevity genes' into maintaining your epigenome. Going into 'repair and protect mode' rather than 'grow and reproduce', and if you think about those things, those are generally all the things that we don't do. But what if slowing aging isn't enough for you? Well, this is where my interview with professor Sinclair took an interesting turn, because he's actually done some research on reversing aging. So how would you do that? Well, effectively, you would need to take the epigenome and reset it back to an earlier time. But how is that possible? Back in 2012, a scientist named Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize for discovering four factors, which when applied in a gene therapy to an adult cell, would reset the whole epigenome back to how that cell was when it was an embryo. So it is what is called a 'pluripotent stem cell'. Now, you wouldn't want to apply that to your entire body because, well, then you would turn into a giant tumor because your cells wouldn't know how to differentiate. But it does suggest that there are ways of resetting your epigenome, and they could be the key to reversing aging. The big breakthrough that we just had in my lab, finally, you know, about a year or so ago, was to reprogram the eye of a mouse. And the eye, we chose the eye because that's a very hard thing to fix, right? If you go blind when you're older, we think that's a one-way thing, you're never going to recover your vision, but we decided: let's try it anyway, let's go for broke. So we put our gene therapy in the eye of old mice, turn their retinas to be young again, reversed aging in their retinas. So those one-year old mice went back to about two months, And guess what? Those mice could see again, just like they were young again. How do you reset one of these eye cells without resetting it to just a stem cell? Well, we have to be very careful not to reset these cells to be basically a stem cell, otherwise, we wouldn't have mice that can see, we'd have mice with a giant tumor in the back of their eyes. So what we do is a couple of things: we didn't use all of the four reprogramming factors that won the Nobel Prize, we use just three, we leave off one called 'cMyc', which causes cancer, and those three seem to be just the right recipe for taking the age of the eye backwards, but not too far. Then, the second thing we do is: we turn it off. We can actually turn this system 'on' when we want, and 'off' again, so that we don't take them too far back in age. Can you do that with any cell? We think we can do this in any tissue. We've now given it to the whole mouse and those mice are fine. No evidence of cancer. They seem to be really quite healthy. So the big question is: can you take a mouse way back, the whole body, and be totally younger? Maybe back from two years, back to two months. And that's what we're doing right now. That's pretty exciting! It's freakishly exciting, actually! I thought we'd just slow down aging, now we're talking about an aging reset. You know what? We've only reset the age of the eye once, But how many times can we do this? Maybe it's twice. Maybe it's a hundred times. So, professor Sinclair claims that his gene therapy reversed aging in the mouse's eye and allowed it to see again. But applying a gene therapy to every one of your trillion cells is pretty impossible. So in order for this to actually work and reset an entire body, you would need another way, and this is where the jellyfish come in, because 'moon jellyfish'—any cell in an adult jellyfish can actually be reset into an earlier stage of its life cycle. It can become a polyp again. So it seems like the jellyfish are actually capable of activating something like the Yamanaka factors and resetting their epigenomes to an earlier time in their lives. If we were able to figure out how they do that, well, then maybe we could do the same with our own cells. We do have the ability to reset our epigenomes, but that is typically only used when we're in the embryonic stage, when we need to maintain all our cells as stem cells. As we age, most mammals including humans, we lose stem cells over time. And the stem cells we do have become more and more restricted over time to the types of cells they can make. So if we can understand how the 'moon jellyfish' can take, presumably, many different kinds of cells, and reverse-engineer them into the cells it needs during regeneration, that might give us an idea of how to do it in ourselves, as well. So, I still think we're a fair ways off from reversing aging in the entire human body. But what I found interesting from talking to professor Sinclair was that there's at least a roadmap. At least a path ahead where you can see that it could be possible to slow and even reverse aging. Hey this part of the video is sponsored by LastPass.

        "description": "Apache Kafka, a distributed event streaming platform that can scale massive pipelines of real-time data.",
        "text": "Apache Kafka, a distributed event streaming platform that can scale massive pipelines of real-time data. It was created in 2011 at LinkedIn, written in Java and Scala, and named Kafka because it's a system optimized for writing. Let's imagine using it to build a dashboard like Google Analytics. When an event occurs, like a website visit, the producer API creates a new record. These records are stored to disk in an ordered immutable log called a topic, which can persist forever or disappear when no longer needed. Topics are distributed and replicated in a cluster, which contains multiple servers called brokers. This makes Kafka full tolerance and able to scale to any workload. On the other side, multiple consumers can subscribe to this data. They can read the most recent message like a queue or read the entire topic log and listen to updates in real time. In addition, it provides a very powerful streams API that can transform and aggregate these topics before they ever reach the consumer. This all may sound similar to message brokers like RabbitMQ, but Kafka can handle more throughput, and is ideal for streaming data applications. For example, it's used today by companies like Lyft to collect and process geolocation data, Spotify and Netflix for log processing, and Cloudflare for real-time analytics. To get started, download it, and use a tool like Zucheeper or K-Raph to manage your cluster. Now, in one terminal start Zucheeper, then in the other start the Kafka server. With the environment up and running, we can now create our first topic. Remember, a topic is just a log of events kept in order. An event will have a key value and timestamp, and may also contain optional metadata and headers. Now, let's use this command to publish an event to the topic, where every line represents a different event. And now, these events are written to a topic, which is stored durably and partitioned in the cluster. Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic will always read the events in the exact same order. Now, with this command, we're able to consume the topic. By default, it will give us the latest event, although we can use the from beginning flag to read the entire log. It's also possible to provide an offset to read a subset of records. At this point, we've achieved basic event streaming, but the Kafka streams API can take things to another level. It's most well-supported with Java and can do things like stateless transformation, like filtering out a subset of events, or state full transformation, like an aggregation that combines multiple events into a single value over a certain window of time. And at that point, you're able to manage real-time streams of data at virtually any scale. This has been Apache Kafka in 100 seconds.

        "text": "How to make art if you're not a nephobab. 1. Make something good. 2. Put it on the internet. 3. Hope that some people notice. Or hope that a lot of people notice. 5. Hope that someone with money notices. 6. Hope they give you money to make your thing. 7. Keep making stuff. But in all seriousness, trying to be a creative person for living is like trying to slush your way through an overgrown jungle. There's not really any straightforward path. One size fits all journey, clear corporate ladder to climb, or levels of certification to obtain. Unless, of course, you benefit from nephatism. Then the path is laid out for you in the silver spoons. Your dad will cast you in his movie, or your mom will introduce you to her modeling agents, and you're on your way to stardom. Or at least a trendy young Hollywood party. Children of celebrities or nephobabies for short have never had such a bad rep. From a question of both togravy to downplaying their privilege, they fight tooth and nail to convince you that they've had to work just as hard. If not harder, then anyone else to escape the looming shadow of their parents' success. I really do feel that once your foot is in the door, which you unfairly got in, then you have to work almost. Twice as hard and the twice is good. A handful are the poster children of four, the underqualified and out of touch. We love to hate them because we're punching up. We don't have the money, connections, and privileges that they're seemingly blind to. Even before nephobabies was in every magazine headline, I've always been the type of person to search up a star, navigate to the early life section of their Wikipedia page, and find out that they went to the kind of high school that costs as much as a four-year college. I've always felt this weird sort of satisfaction knowing that they couldn't possibly be successful by the virtue of their own merit. Of course, it had something to do with their parents, hyperlinked in blue, who could afford to spend thousands of dollars on their education, or the fact that when a paltrow was their second cousin once removed. As someone who wants to be in the entertainment industry, it's discouraging to see that so many of the people who make it come from backgrounds that look nothing like mine. And the harsh reality is that in America, the greatest predictors of future success are informed by things you can't control, like socioeconomic status and race, if you're not rich and not white, and think about this too much in your daily life, things seem bleak. So I'm trying to focus more on what I can control my artistic practice. An artistic practice is sort of like the scientific method for creativity, at least that's what I think it is. It's a way for you to make sure that you're actually doing the thing you want to do. Make art, whether it's writing, painting, or pottery. One of the most well-known proponents of an artistic practice is Julia Cameron. She wrote a book called The Artist's Way, a guide to help people transform the way that they approach their art and creativity. She came up with the method to try to get out of her own creative red as a writer and it worked, so she began teaching workshops on creativity that helped artists and creative people from all sorts of backgrounds. The medium didn't matter, it was all about her method. She helped the creatively challenged Blossom into working artists. One of my college professors was a huge fan of The Artist's Way and had us do a lot of exercises for me as a part of our homework. So a few weeks ago when an all-too-familiar creative block started bubbling up in my brain, I decided to buy The Artist's Way. If it could turn a curmudgeonly lawyers into prolific painters, perhaps it could turn me a recent art school grad into an artist. I've always had a hard time labeling myself with a term like artist. In my mind, real artists make art. They don't just spend a bunch of time thinking about it like I do. And even though I have made things like short films, I even have a hard time calling myself a filmmaker without inserting the word aspiring before it. In The Artist's Way, Julia Cameron says that kind of thinking comes from your sensor with a capital C. Your sensor, she says, keeps up a constant stream of subversive remarks that are often disguised as the truth. It's a nasty internal critic that tells you things like your ideas suck and you're not creative. And the smarter you get, the smarter your sensor gets. If you write one good play, it'll try to convince you that that's all there is. If you draw a sketch, it'll probably say something like it's no Picasso. Julia Cameron has a few methods to evade the sensor and begin your creative journey. The first is to write morning pages, which is basically journaling three pages of whatever the heck comes to your head in the morning. Because there is no wrong way to write the morning pages, the sensor's opinion simply doesn't count another method to escape the sensor's clutches is to turn all the negative things it says into affirmations. If it says you're untalented, you must combat it with the inverse and declare. I am talented. If it says you can't write, you must say I am a brilliant and prolific writer. Full disclosure, I haven't actually finished this book yet, so I'm not some fully changed woman with creativity oozing out of my orifices yet. There's 12 chapters that you've read over full weeks, but these initial tools have at least made me a bit more optimistic about my artistic future and have inspired me to write more. Even if it's just a script for a YouTube video that doesn't really have a point like this one. Trigger warning, this is the part of the video where we get into hashtag YouTuber problems territory, which I am fully aware can be really annoying to hear about because being a YouTuber is like the one job where you can basically do anything you want. I am hesitant to talk about YouTuber problems to non YouTubers because I'm a firm believer in complaining to the right audience, you know, like how you wouldn't complain about your kids to someone who isn't verbal, but you decided to watch me so I guess you are the target audience. Anyway, like many YouTubers, I have experienced the B word burnout. It's hard to tell when it starts and when it ends, it's a slow, well burn. If you're anything like me, you convince yourself that there's no way you could possibly have it because you haven't even created enough to get to that point. But there isn't some magical number or threshold to pass that puts you over the edge. For me, it's like a fuzzy gray static has taken over the part of my brain where ideas and excitement to create them used to live and no matter how many times I try to change the channel, the static persists. The worst part about being in the state of not creating is that I'm still constantly thinking about the fact that I should be creating. I'm still thinking about ideas, but those ideas are like seeds and the static is like this poisonous gas that sucks the life out of them before they can even begin to grow. I try to communicate the static with different tactics, exercise, reading, self-help books, watching things that inspire me, and these strategies help a little bit, but I know the only way I can truly confront the static is to cut through it by making something, anything. That's why I'm making this video. I think one of the most simple but effective pieces of creative advice I've heard is make what you want to see. That's what I try to keep top of mind when I started writing this video. There are many things I want to see, but I think a good place to start when practically responding to make what you want to see is to ask yourself, what do I already watch or read or listen to? The media you consume is pretty good at informing, but you want to see and subsequently what you should make. After taking stock of what I consume, I recognize some common themes. One, reality TV. Two, well-crafted coming of age narratives about 20-something trying to figure out their lives. Three, creative people I admire talking about how they make their work. Clearly this isn't a reality show. It is however a video featuring a 20-something who was trying to figure out her life and creative process. So I'm doing it, right? I'm making what I want to see. Kind of. Radio host and producer, Ira Glass has this great theory known as the taste gap. He says, nobody tells this to people who are beginners. I wish someone told me, all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. With a first couple of years you make stuff. It's just not that good. It's trying to be good. It has a lot of potential, but it's not. Your taste, the thing that got you into the game is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this face. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you got to know it's normal. And the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. It's going to take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just got to fight your way through. So when I said that I'm only kind of making what I want to see, it's because I haven't fully lived up to the standards of my oh so impeccably refined taste. And I have to be comfortable with that for a while because the only way to get there is to continue creating.",

        "description": " How to get rid of the caffeine jitters.",
        "text": " How to get rid of the caffeine jitters. When you've had too much caffeine, how do you get rid of the stress, the irritability, and the discomfort that comes along with it? You don't want to wait hours for the caffeine to pass through your system. Maybe you drink some extra coffee to wake yourself up and get some work done, but now you're so hyped up that you can't even focus. Well, over the weekend this happened to me. We went out for breakfast and I made the mistake of having a little too much coffee and I paid the price. It was really uncomfortable, but luckily I knew three things I could do to balance myself out and after about 15 or 20 minutes I was feeling a lot better. I'll teach you those three things in this video. By the way, my name's Luke and welcome to Headfulness. This is my channel where I teach people how to get out of their heads. So if you're trying to overcome anxiety or if you're just trying to become more mindful, click the subscribe button so you get all of my anxiety relief and mindfulness tips. But what are the three things I did to get rid of the coffee jitters? Well, the first thing I did is I took a supplement called L-fionine. It comes from green tea and it's very calming. It's an amino acid that helps your body produce GABA and it's great at balancing out caffeine. In fact, if you look up caffeine supplements on Amazon or other websites, you'll see that there are some they sell that's a combination of caffeine and L-fionine. And there's even some published research that shows that caffeine combined with L-fionine has a positive effect on cognitive performance and mood. So I take it when I have a lot of work to do because it really helps me stay focused. You'll have to experiment and find out what dosage works for you. Most bottles recommend around 200 milligrams, but for me I need like 400 to 600 to see any effect, so it'll depend on your body weight and your absorption. So that's the first thing I did when I had the coffee jitters over the weekend. I took an L-fionine supplement to balance things out. Then I did a breathing exercise called boutique breathing. And I talked about this a little bit in a recent video called reset button for the brain, but I'll explain it quickly here. The first step is to do an easy breath hold. Take a normal breath in and a normal breath out and then hold your breath until you get the first urge to breathe. For me this is about 25 to 30 seconds, but for you it could be a little longer or a little shorter, but just hold your breath until you get that first urge to breathe. Then take a one minute break and just breathe normally in and out through your nose. Then for the next two to five minutes do what they call very light breathing. The goal here is to keep yourself hungry for air. So take very light inhales. Don't breathe as deeply and fully as you would like. But also don't make it too hard on yourself. Just keep yourself hungry for air for a few minutes. Then finish with one more breath hold and you'll be feeling nice and relaxed. Then the third thing I did was I smoothed out my heart rate variability. So what is heart rate variability? Well here's the 30 second explanation. Your heart rate is constantly speeding up and slowing down. And when you're stressed your heart rate looks like this red graph here. It looks squiggly and unpredictable and it has all these sharp points. But when you're calm and relaxed your heart rate looks more like this blue graph. It's smooth, rhythmic and predictable. This is what they call cardiac coherence. And there's a breathing exercise you can do that will help smooth out your heart rate variability and make it look like this. But when I had the coffee jitters over the weekend my heart rate looked like this picture on the left. This is a screenshot from some pile feedback software I use. You can see that it's got that that squiggly, unpredictable pattern with the sharp points. But after taking the L-theonine, doing the potato breathing and then doing the breathing exercise that I teach in my book my heart rate looked like this picture on the right. And I was feeling way less jittery and a lot more comfortable and a lot more calm and relaxed. So what is the breathing exercise that smoothes out your heart rate variability? Any health through your nose for six seconds, then exhale through your mouth for six seconds and pretend like you're blowing out a candle and then maintain that rhythm for several minutes in through the nose out through the mouth. You can use an animation like this to keep your breathing on that steady rhythm. But this is the first secret to smoothing out your heart rate variability. There's really six things you need to do to get your heart rate to take on that nice smooth pattern and feel calm and relaxed. So if you want to learn how to do it, you can download my free e-book breathing secrets. It's totally free to download. Just go to breathing secrets book.com, sign up for my newsletter and I'll send you the book right away. It's like 30 pages long, so it doesn't take too long to read, but it's too much for me to go over in this video. So I'll put the link down below. It's breathing secrets book.com. You'll also get access to this breath-pacer app so you can keep your breathing on that steady rhythm like I mentioned earlier. So those are the three things I did to get rid of the caffeine jitters. I took some L-F-E-N-E-N. I did some breath-holds and then I smoothed out my heart rate variability.

        "text": "[Music] hey guys and welcome to a wardrobe essentials video i feel like such an old school youtuber doing this because i watched so many of these videos when i was like in middle school in high school harley rae jepsen was playing zoella was still big on youtube and there were a ton of wardrobe essentials videos now granted i thought they were really helpful but i feel like they always just told you like you need a t-shirt and like no [ __ ] of course i need a t-shirt but like how am i supposed to choose a good t-shirt and what brand should i buy it from and what's an affordable option and a more expensive option so those are things that i'm hopefully going to include in this video today i really want to give you guys like a more comprehensive guide to how to pick a flattering fit and good quality pieces so that you can build a solid base to your wardrobe and then branch out from there for me and i think a lot of people investing in basics is kind of a hard process like mentally because it just sucks to spend you know 20 50 100 on something that seems so not exciting basic one might even say but think of these basics as the building blocks of your wardrobe and you can't get to like the top of the fashion tower without having a solid foundation metaphors and even if you keep your style more simple having like an amazing fitting pair of jeans and a t-shirt and a leather jacket can make you seem so well styled and like really stylish even though you're wearing just a combination of basic pieces so without further ado let's jump into it now i wanted to talk about this first because a good pair of jeans is like finding a [ __ ] rare pokemon like you really have to hunt them down now everybody's gonna have their different genes preferences but here are some of my main criteria for finding the perfect pair of jeans i always look for a high-rise jean and i mean a high high-priced jean i have like a really long torso compared to my legs so i need an 11 to 12 inch rise in order for it to like reach my belly button region secondly i look for a straight fit throughout the legs something that feels a little bit vintage inspired it feels a little bit more grown up than a jegging and thirdly i look at where it ends on the ankle if it's too long and it hits your foot it can end up looking a little bit like messy and your legs actually look shorter if it ends like capri length without being a culotte or something intentional that can also look pretty awkward so angle length is where you want them to end if your jeans are a raw hem like these ones you can always take some scissors and cut off an inch or two from the bottom so that the hem is perfect for you i end up doing that on a lot of my jeans just because i can't find the perfect length jean otherwise and my last main criteria is fabric i am such a nerd for denim fabrics like five years ago when i worked at american eagle jeggings were the [ __ ] and everybody wanted stretch denim i know it is more comfortable to start out with but i actually recommend quite a stiff denim it's gonna last longer and not rip in the crotch like all of my jeggings did when i was in high school and it's also going to give you a more structured expensive just like good true denim look so check the material label on the inside of your jeans this is 100 cotton which is what i would recommend you could also do 95 cotton and 5 spandex if you want a little bit of stretch i wouldn't recommend going over 5 spandex because then it does get a little bit stretchy and the jeans won't last as long or look as clean on your legs that brings me to my specific jean brand recommendations we're going to work our way from most expensive to least expensive so first up we have redone and god damn these cost a pretty penny but they are sustainable amazing quality and they also offer free repairs for life however if you have a bit of a booty and i mean like even a little bit because even my butt is a little bit big for these jeans they may not be the best fit they don't have too much stretch and they're really built for more of like a rectangular straight up and down figure next we have jeans from oricia which are a pretty damn good dupe for the redone jeans these have a little bit of stretch to them so i find them really comfortable just going about my daily life when i want a little bit more room to breathe and move around madewell is also a great option especially if you're a bit curvier since these jeans have the most stretch out of any of mine their jeans do run like a hundred to two hundred dollars but if you catch them on sale i bought madewell jeans for like twenty dollars so they can be actually kind of an affordable option if you get lucky next we have my current favorite pair of jeans they are from athens which is a small sustainable australian brand i love how high-waisted these are i love the fit on the leg i love the back pocket detail that feels a little bit like 70s it feels kind of retro and at 70 these are a pretty reasonable price for a good pair of jeans and then last up i have some vintage levi's that i thrifted and then altered now i find that vintage levi's are so hard to find in smaller sizes so if you are more petite don't be afraid to get out a sewing machine or a needle or just ask your mom to help you out and take in the waste of the jeans so that they fit you a little bit better but it's aerodynamic i used to be very casual about my short shopping i just like buy whatever was on sale for 20 but i honestly think that you need to give as much thought to buying a denim pair of shorts as you do to a denim pair of jeans if you're like me i wear shorts every single day during the summer and if you buy a cheap pair they will wear out by the end these ones are my new favorite they are from a brand jeans i got them off princess polly and they cost nearly a hundred dollars which i know is quite expensive for shorts but seriously like the denim on these is so much higher quality and it's gonna last so much longer than something from like hollister i always look for a very high waisted kind of festival inspired fit i tend to go a size up with my shorts because since they're already like so short on the butt i like there to be a little bit more room around the crotch so it's not like ultra tight it's also really great in the summer so your crotch doesn't get too sweaty i also look for shorts that seem a little bit long to begin with like i like my shorts pretty goddamn short so when i first got these i'm like this is you know a two and a half inch inseam that's a little bit conservative for my taste but as the shorts get more worn in this part is gonna start to crinkle up as you sit down and like move around so they're gonna end up looking like a little bit more bootylicious than these original shorts if you aren't into that booty-tastic look though here is a slightly more conservative pair from athens i love how like 90s inspired these are and i feel like they definitely stand out from the range of like typical high-waisted denim shorts this oh gosh now black boots come in a million different styles so i have a couple options to show you guys for my recommendations but these are my first ones if you're in college or walk around a lot dr martins are 100 my recommendation because they're comfortable they're weatherproof but they also add a good bit of personality to your outfit and they're built to last for decades i know people like go to the grave with their dog bartons they've had them for decades and decades so they are a really good investment as well next i have some healed booties in case you need a little bit of height or you're a bit more of a fancy type of gal these are actually from nasty gal and they cost like 30 bucks they were pretty goddamn affordable what i look for in a healed boot is a block heel so they're more comfortable to walk in you can do some good old stomping in these and they aren't going anywhere i also am quite particular about my toe shape these are a square toe which i think is really groovy it's kind of 70s inspired and a little bit more funky versus something like a round toe which is a little bit more like 2010 and lastly i take a look at this ankle area and make sure that it hugs my ankle snugly i don't like boots that are kind of loose and like flaccid around the ankle because it can make your leg look chunkier it interrupts like the nice shapely curve that you have going on so i definitely like something that's more form-fitting it also makes it so easy to tuck underneath my straight leg jeans it just goes whoop right on top and creates a really sleek silhouette and then my last boot recommendation is such a statement if dr martins aren't enough for you like definitely give these a try these are the shoes of my 2012 tumblr dreams they are so so cool and they're surprisingly really easy to walk in considering how high these heels are so if you're looking for a basic that's not super basic i would recommend these [Music] there aren't that many sneaker brands out there so i'm just gonna tell you like the exact models that i would recommend these are the nike air force one jesters they're called the jesters because the logo is like melted down kind of salvador dali style onto the bottom of the shoe which i think is like kind of groovy and these are incredibly comfortable they look good with jeans they look good with a dress i honestly like can't think of an outfit these wouldn't work with my other sneaker recommendations are the fila destroyers this is like a bit more of a funky dad shoe dad shoe these are great for when i feel like making more of a statement and i also have these vintage reeboks as you can tell by how yellow they are these have gotten a lot of love they are really comfortable and lightweight and they're a very low profile understated shoe if you are looking for something that's more subtle my last shoe basic is this kind of i don't know what to call it it's like a pointy block heel type shoe i look for a nude or cream color something neutral that will go with a lot of outfits but also blend into my leg and make my leg look a bit more elongated i really like a pointed toe so again it elongates the toe box and makes your legs look a little bit longer and a block heel that's just an inch or two is perfect because it gives you some height but it's still really walkable if you're looking for shoes like this i would recommend steve madden makes a damn good shoe and i would also recommend topshop i think these are like kind of a british style shoe so i think they have some on their website as well [Music] this took me so long to figure out but victoria's secret broads suck somehow they have managed to throw like 5 million marketing dollars at all of us and i grew up thinking that victoria's secret genuinely had the most comfortable bras out there but oh ho ho i was wrong so i would recommend gary is a great option this is my favorite bralette from them it's really comfortable it's unlined and it's the perfect amount of lacy so i don't really mind if it peeks through my shirt i would also recommend calvin klein which is the bra that i'm wearing right now wow take a take a good look at that smooth well-supported breast folks calvin klein makes really good bras i've washed this like 50 times i wear it nearly every day to be honest and she's still holding up great surprise surprise folks you never could have guessed it yeah white t-shirt black t-shirt essentials in the wardrobe now you'd think that most t-shirts are made equal and they're made of a similar fabric they're a similar cut who really cares but i care that's who i recommend try on your t-shirts in stores just like you're shopping for a pair of jeans go to like five different stores try on a bunch of different t-shirts in different sizes and different cuts at each store and come out with your favorite take a close look at the fabric and feel how does it drape how does it fit me on the shoulders are the sleeves flattering on my arms this one is from redone which is sustainable but also you know 80 dollars so i know everybody can't buy this for more affordable options check out everlane madewell or brandy melville one of the t-shirts that i've worn for like five years is actually from forever 21. the key was to make sure that it was 100 cotton and i sized up to a medium for a slightly more relaxed bit now our next essential is a white blouse or really any type of top that's fancy enough to be like a nice top and jeans outfit on a blast like this i personally look for a wide neckline so that i can show off my collarbone area and i also look for little details that elevate it for example this has a corset top it has this frill detail around the bottom and around the bust and the sleeves have a little puff at the top and at the cuff so it just makes the whole thing look very like fancy pirate i don't know it has a lot of detail so even if you pair it with something more basic it's going to elevate the whole outfit next up we have a black turtleneck pair it with a red lip and a low bun your channel in those audrey hepburn vibes if you pair it with jeans your channel in those steve jobs vibes equally fashionable equally great options this is an essential for me because it's perfect for layering i love layering a strappy dress a strappy thrifted cami even like a corset detail situation on top of this and it is the perfect background for those days that's a little bit chillier this one is actually a bodysuit which is not essential but it's actually so nice when you are layering it with a bunch of other pieces of clothing to have the body suit that keeps it all nicely tucked into the crotch area this one is from summersault which is like a small female-owned brand genuinely the best turtleneck i have ever felt it's a ribbed material it's so stretchy i love the bodysuit on it but again you can find these pretty much anywhere asos everlane you can really find them anywhere for like under 20 i have a personal vendetta against crewnecks on sweaters i think they look so boring and like unflattering so i love that this sweater has a mock neck it has a balloon sleeve and a chunky knit so it has all of those little details that help a basic piece look not so basic i've also thrifted a bunch of my favorite sweaters including this one if you're thrifting look out for 100 silk and 100 cashmere sweaters they're surprisingly easy to find and really bougie really good materials that age quite well now a little black dress will forever be a classic but i actually don't own one and instead i own a little patterned dress i feel like since the age of reformation and these little like flirty summery dresses this is the new little black dress at least in my opinion especially because i have so many solid colors in the rest of my wardrobe i love something with a fun pattern to change it up what i look for in a dress is obviously a good fit i also look for a good zipper because this is the death of like many a cheap dress is this zipper not going up and down properly so make sure she is sturdy and secure this one is a very fancy one from privacy please they make the most stunning dresses i would say i like them better than reformations dresses i know that's that's heresy i also love this dress from urban outfitters i recently made a video with 10 ways to style it and i love how versatile this dress is and it's very like picnic a [ __ ] but like vintage picnic [ __ ] and of course you can find a cute dress at any price point this one is from forever 21 and this looks like some reformation [ __ ] it is so so cute on this one is one from brandy melville which i know is kind of shitty because they only have one size and the one size is like extra small but if you do happen to fit them brandy melville has some really cute and really comfortable dresses as well as you guys might be able to tell by my outfit i am a fan of a good denim jacket they have been in style for so long that you can find one so easily at the thrift store if you can't find the perfect one in the women's section check out the men's section and you can find a really cool oversized fit like this this one i thrifted for like 15 it was so affordable i always look for a denim jacket that has a little bit more of a plain wash i don't want too much distressing too much craziness going on and i also love the contrast stitching on this one i think it adds a really cool detail i also wanted to show you guys this jacket which i got new from levi's this is just like a good ass jacket you know when you hold something that's like well made and you're just like oh this is a good a good item of clothing that's how i feel in this jacket i don't know if you guys went through this phase but in middle school every year i would get so attached to one hoodie jacket situation and i would wear that hoodie every single day to school for the rest of the year this jacket is my version of my middle school hoodie it feels so safe and like comfortable and it's just a really genuinely well-made article of clothing which is kind of hard to find these days my last clothing essential is a leather jacket this is my favorite leather jacket and it is from asos i got it for like 50 bucks unfortunately it is sold out right now but i'll tell you about the criteria that i looked for in this jacket and maybe you can find your own as well the number one thing that i love about this is the way the sleeves fit as you can see this is nearly like a dolman sleeve it's a very large armpit area because leather is such a stiff material i want that extra room so i can easily lift up my arms i've made that mistake in the past with my leather jackets i've gotten them a little bit too snug and then i like don't have proper arm mobility the second thing i looked at was the length of this jacket i really like that it is on the crop side especially because i wear so many high-waisted jeans or fit and flare dresses i want a jacket that ends closer to my waist than my hips so that it maintains my like hourglass there isn't an hourglass figure but like it maintains kind of my illusion of like an hourglass figure and a more high-waisted silhouette if that makes sense and the third thing i looked at was the hardware i love that the hardware on this isn't a super bright silver instead it's this worn-in copper tone it's a lot more understated and especially as somebody who wears a lot of gold jewelry this matches my accessories a lot better now this is something that i've just been recently getting into because while i was still in school i just had a backpack and i loved my falafel kajankin a fall raven kanken this was a really good backpack while i was in school but now that i'm an adult now that i'm an adult i'm not a real adult now that i'm like a fake adult i have been getting into purses here's my criteria for a good purse first of all material is key vegans don't come for me but i am a fan of a good leather material secondly i look for some interesting hardware so i love the ring detail on this one and it has some rings up near the straps as well and thirdly i look for something that is easy to wear and easy to open i cannot stand purses that have like a buckle and like five magnets and like a security code that's six stitches long i just want something that you can open put your stuff in take it back out granted this might be different if you live in a city with a lot of pickpockets or thieves so this is my current favorite it is from coza numbers which is a really small brand they make a goddamn good purse i cannot lie it is a little bit expensive though so if you are on a budget i would also recommend nasty gal and asos surprisingly have really good purses this one is from nastygal it's like a cool croc type of bag this one is from asos this isn't like a basic bag but it is one of the coolest bags that i own and of course if you have a good eye you can thrift bags as well this one is something that i thrifted recently and i love the kind of like 90s early 2000s aesthetic that it has all right those are all the basics that i have that's the end of this video thank you guys so much for watching hope it was helpful and i will see you guys next week bye [Music] you",

        "description": "If you're talking to Elon or you want to have a conversation with Elon and you get that opportunity to talk to Elon, you need to be concise, quick.",
        "text": "If you're talking to Elon or you want to have a conversation with Elon and you get that opportunity to talk to Elon, you need to be concise, quick. There's definitely 2am texts and 6am conference calls. When I used to go into meetings with him, I used to always stop by our barista and I would get a couple of spresles and chug that down and then go into the meetings. He has never said this, but I've watched it. You have 30 seconds to make your point. Elon Musk is known by his employees to be intense. When he took over Tesla in 2008, he sent the company into crisis mode to jumpstart his vision of how to reinvent the auto industry. Now, he appears to be using a similar management playbook to remake Twitter. We spoke with former Tesla and SpaceX employees to better understand how Musk became known for his cup throat and tireless management style and what that may mean for his future employees. Step 1 for Musk is to rally employees around a lofty company mission. It's exactly what inspired Carl Medlock to join Tesla in 2009. We were all so excited about the brand. I mean, all work on 80-100 hours a week. We lost track of our families, our passions, our hobbies and all that stuff, but we love what we're doing. I never once had Elon or saw Elon do a raw raw meeting like that. Medlock now runs his own electric vehicle repair shop in Seattle. He said he was terminated from Tesla in 2013 over a misunderstanding with his direct manager. Garrett Reesman was similarly inspired by the mission of SpaceX and joined in 2011. It's a very demanding environment, but by and large it's not because of him cracking the whip. You know, making human life multiplanetary, getting the Mars, having a colony of Mars, is something that motivates pretty much everybody there at SpaceX. Reesman left SpaceX in 2018 to teach astronomical engineering at the University of Southern California. He said that after seven years at SpaceX, he wanted to work somewhere less intense. Yet at Twitter, the mission isn't exactly saving the world. They are talking about protecting free speech, which of course is important, but it is not as dramatic as trying to go to Mars. Tim Higgins is a tech and automotive reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and author of PowerPlay, a book that traces the rise of Tesla at Elon Musk. Well, the challenge that Elon has going to have at Twitter is what are the stakes? Neither Elon Musk nor Twitter responded to requests for comment. The company's mission is what Musk hopes will drive people to be hardcore, a term he uses to describe working long hours at high intensity. He just kept it put in, you know, 80-hour, 80-hour weeks every week. Obviously, people at two o'clock in the morning because we finished up an event and we were all still under dry because we're having such a good time. And Musk has used this idea of hardcore to rally his team over the years as they approach hard challenges. For example, in 2012, when Tesla was preparing to ramp up production of the Model S luxury sedan, Musk sent his team an email with a subject line, Ultra-Hard-Core, telling them to prepare for a level of intensity that most of them had never experienced before. About three weeks after taking over at Twitter, Musk sent a similar email. But hundreds of employees opted to leave the company rather than sign up for Musk's vision of Twitter 2.0. The challenge here is Elon is inherited a huge workforce and he has to convince them to be on Team Elon. And we're seeing him try to go through those ranks of people to find the talent that he's going to need to pivot the company to a private Twitter. And it's messy. Musk himself leads by hardcore example. I just even like capture there. Last time I see her actually stepped literally on the floor because the couch was too narrow. I shut up at work early one day and it was just me and him and once the security guy had the entire 5.5 million square fee. And I didn't know he was there, right? And at the factory when you, there's walkways and safety areas and stuff like that, when nobody's there, I just got on a bicycle riding around and here Elon is asleep on this engineer's desk. In November, Musk tweeted that he was sleeping at Twitter's offices in San Francisco. And it's not just his time but his money. How much did you put into this company? Oh man, about $55 million. In 2008, when Tesla was at its darkest moment and he put in his personal last millions of dollars to fund it, he was even, you know, couch surfing in Menlo Park and paying my business expenses with personal credit card debt, right? His approach is to do anything required to keep his businesses competitive and he lived that every single day when I worked for him. Conrad left Tesla in 2011 for a no Nissan Mitsubishi. The people that I've talked to with Elon talk about how he, in one hand, is incredibly inspiring. But on the other hand, a lot of people will say he was also exhausting and mercurial and after a while they just couldn't keep up with him. There is also a history of employees at Tesla, he caught about 20% of the workforce. About a week after he took over Twitter, Musk laid off roughly 50% of the staff according to a document seen by the journal. And people familiar with the matter estimated that likely over 1,000 have resigned. Former employees have said that this cutthroat approach instils in them this feeling that anyone working for Musk is the best of the best. Back in the day at Tesla, Elon would often say that people who work for him are special forces. He wants to hire a key engineer who, in his mind, has way more value than say 100 engineers and to deploy those top talent on the hardest problems and be able to move faster and not have the same kind of level of bureaucracy. Former employees have said that Musk avoids traditional corporate hierarchy. If Elon was interested in something you were doing, he would come and talk directly to you. He's not going to go through a bunch of different layers of management and have the information filter up. Musk also motivates employees to work harder by raising the financial stakes. When Elon became CEO of Tesla, the economy was in shambles. It was the great recession and there was huge questions about whether people were going to want to buy a luxury car and not just a luxury car, a luxury car that was electric. Similarities to Twitter today, we've got an uncertain economy. The company needs to start generating more money. It has a huge debt load. It has to find its place in this social media world that's under a lot of pressure as the ad market contracts. In November, Musk wrote in an email to Twitter employees that without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn. Musk is still in the earliest stages of setting up his strategy for Twitter and finding people he trusts to help him transform the company. That's basics. If he proved yourself to be capable, innovative, especially on a technical level, then that led to very, very rapid advancement throughout the company. If I were an employee at Twitter right now, I'd probably just do your job. Don't let him know your name.",

        "text": "- I've heard you talk before\nabout some of the prime movers for longevity and all risk mortality. And I'd love for you to review\na little bit of that for us. I think we all know\nthat we shouldn't smoke because it's very likely\nthat we'll die earlier, if we smoke nicotine. I'm neither a marijuana\nnor a nicotine smoker, So I feel on stable ground there. But anytime we say smoking nowadays, people really want to distinguish between cannabis and nicotine. So I am curious about\nany differences there, in terms of impact on longevity. But in that context, what are the things\nthat anyone and everyone can do, should do, to\nlive longer, basically? - How long you got? - Well, you tell me,\n[people laughing] you tell me, I'd like to live to be, I'd like my final decade\nto be between 90 and a 100. - Oh no, I meant how\nlong do you, yeah, yeah. - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. - And will we spend\nfrom now until you're 90 talking about this?\n- Well there's a risk of that. - So, let's start with\na couple of the things that you've already highlighted. So smoking, how much does\nsmoking increase your risk of all-cause mortality? And the reason we like to\ntalk about what's called ACM, or all-cause mortality,\nis it's really agnostic to how you die. And that doesn't always make sense, I mean, if you're talking about, a very specific intervention\nlike a anti-cancer therapeutic you really care about\ncancer-specific mortality, or heart-specific mortality. But when we talk about these broad things we like to talk about ACM. So, using smoking. Smoking is approximately a 40%\nincrease in the risk of ACM. - What does that translate to in, that means I'm shortening my life by 40%? - No, it means at any point in time, there's a 40% greater risk\nthat you're going to die relative to a non-smoker\n- Got it. - and a never-smoker. Yeah, yeah, so it's\nimportant to distinguish. It doesn't mean your lifespan\nis going to be 40% less, it means at any point\nin time, standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher. And by the way, that'll\ncatch up with you, right? At some point that that catches up. High blood pressure, it's\nabout a 20 to 25% increase in all-cause mortality. You take something really extreme like endstage kidney disease, so these are patients\nthat are on dialysis, waiting for an organ. And again, there's a confounder there because what's the underlying condition that leads you to that? It's profound hypertension,\nsignificant type 2 diabetes that's been uncontrolled. That's enormous, that's\nabout 175% increase in ACM. So the hazard ratio is 2.75.\n- Mm-hmm. - Type two diabetes is\nprobably about a 1.25 as well, so 25% increase. So now the question is\nlike, how do you improve? So what are the things that improve those? So now here we do this by\ncomparing low to high achievers and other metrics. So if you look at low muscle\nmass versus high muscle mass, what is the improvement? And it's pretty\nsignificant, it's about 3x. So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people, as they age, the low muscle mass people\nhave about a 3x hazard ratio or 200% increase in all-cause mortality. Now, if you look at the\ndata more carefully, you realize that it's probably\nless the muscle mass fully doing that, and it's\nmore the high association with strength. And when you start to tease out strength you can realize that strength could be probably 3.5x as a hazard ratio, meaning about 250% greater risk if you have low strength to high strength. - And high strength is\nthe ability to move loads at 80 to 90-\n- So it's all defined by given studies. So the most common things that are used are actually, they're used for\nthe purposes of experiments that make it easy to do. And I don't even think\nthey're the best metrics. So they're usually using grip\nstrength, leg extensions, and wall sits, squats, things like that. - Okay.\n- So how long can you sit in a squatted position at\n90 degrees without support, would be a great demonstration\nof quad strength, a leg extension, how\nmuch weight can you hold, for how long, relative to body weight? Things like that. We have a whole strength program that we do with our patients, we have something called the SMA. So it's the Strength Metrics Assessment, and we put them through 11\ntests that are really difficult, like a dead hang is one of them, how long can you dead\nhang your body weight, stuff like that. So, we're trying to be more\ngranular in that insight but tie it back to these principles. If you look at cardiorespiratory fitness, it's even more profound. So, if you look at people\nwho are in the bottom 25% for their age and sex, in terms of VO2 max, and you compare them to the people that are just at\nthe 50th to 75th percentile, you're talking about a\n2x difference, roughly, in the risk of ACM. If you compare the bottom\n25% to the top 2.5%, so you're talking about,\nbottom quarter to the elite for a given age, you're talking about 5x. - Wow, yeah.\n- 400% difference in all-cause mortality. That's probably the single\nstrongest association I've seen for any modifiable behavior. - Incredible, so when you\nsay elite these are people that are running marathons\nat a pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily, it's just\nwhat the Vo2 max is for that, my Vo2 max would be in the\nelite for my age group. My Vo2 max, but then again,\nI'm training very deliberately to make sure that it's in that. So, I wouldn't consider myself\nelite at anything anymore, but I still maintain a Vo2\nmax that is elite for my age. - I'd consider you an elite\nphysician and podcaster [Peter laughing]\nand guy, all around, but, true. But in terms of, okay so for-\n- But the point is you don't have to be a world class athlete to be elite here, yeah.\n- Got it. - Yeah,\n- Got it. So maybe we could talk a little bit about the specifics around the training to get into the top two tiers there, because it seems that those\nare enormous positive effects of cardiovascular exercise, far greater than the sorts\nof numbers that I see around, let's just say, supplement\nA, or supplement B. - Well, and that's, you know this is my whole pet peeve in life, right? It's like, I just can't get enough of the machinating and arguing about this supplement\nversus that supplement. And I feel like you shouldn't\nbe having those arguments until you have your\nexercise house in order. You shouldn't be arguing about your, this nuance of your carnivore diet, versus this nuance of your paleo diet, versus this nuance of your vegan diet, until you can deadlift your\nbody weight for 10 reps, then you can come and\ntalk about those things - let's just come up with some\n- You're right. metrics,\n- Yeah. - until your Vo2 max is at\nleast to the 75th percentile, and you're able to dead\nhang for at least a minute, and you're able to wall\nsit for at least two, we could rattle off a bunch of\nrelatively low hanging fruit, I wish there was a rule that said you couldn't talk about\nanything else, health related. - We can make that rule. - [laughs] No one will listen to it. - Well, I don't know about that, we can make whatever rules we want. We can call it Attia's rule. One thing I've done before on this podcast and on social media is just borrowing from the tradition in science, which is, it's inappropriate to name\nsomething after yourself, unless you were a scientist before 1950. But it's totally\nappropriate to name things after other people, so I'm\ngoing to call it Attia's rule, until you can do the following things, don't talk about supplements.\n- Please refrain from talking about\nsupplements and nutrition. - There it is, hereafter, thought of, referred to, and referenced as Attia's rule. I coined the phrase, not him, so there's no ego involved,\nbut it is now Attia's rule. Watch out! #attia'srule. - Oh God. - Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule. In all seriousness, and\nI am serious about that. Dead hang for about a minute, seems like a really good\ngoal for a lot of people. At least-\n- That's our goal, I think we have a minute\nand a half is the goal for a 40 year old woman, two minutes is the goal\nfor 40 year old man. So we adjust them up and\ndown based on age and gender. - Great, and then the wall sit? What are some numbers?\n- We don't use the wall sit. We do just a straight squat,\nair squat, at 90 degrees, and I believe two minutes is the standard for both men and women at 40. - Great, and then, because for some people\nthinking in terms of VO2 max is a little more complicated, they might not have\naccess to the equipment or to measure it, et cetera. What can we talk about, think about in terms of cardiovascular? So run a mile at seven minutes or less, eight minutes or less?\n- That's a good question. So there are Vo2, there\nare really good Vo2 max estimators online, and you can\nplug in your activity d'Azur, so, be it a bike, run, or rowing machine, and it can give you a sense of that. And I don't, I used to know all of those, - Oh, that's okay.\n- But now that I just actually do the testing,\nI don't recall them. But it's exactly that line of thinking, can you run a mile in this time? If you can, your Vo2 max\nis approximately this. - Great.\n- And I think somewhere in my podcast realm I've got all those charts posted of like, this is by age, by sex, this is what the Vo2 max is\nin each of those buckets. - Terrific, we'll provide links to those, we'll have our people find those links. And then you mentioned dead\nlifting body weight 10 times. - I just made that one up. We don't, that's not one\nthat we include, but- - [Andrew] Something like that? - We we use farmer carries, so we'll say for a male you\nshould be able to farmer carry your body weight for, I\nthink we have two minutes. So that's half your body\nweight in each hand, you should be able to walk\nwith that for for two minutes. For women, I think we're\ndoing 75% of body weight, or something like that, yeah. - Great, I love it. As indirect measures of how healthy and, - Yeah, huge.\n- we are, and how long we're going to live.\n- Yeah, it's basically grip strength, it's mobility, I mean, again, walking\nwith that much weight for some people initially is really hard. We use different things\nlike vertical jump, ground contact time if\nyou're jumping off a box, things like that, so it's\nreally trying to capture, and it's it's an evolution, right? I think the test is going to get only more and more\ninvolved as we get evolved, 'cause it took us about a year, Beth Lewis did the majority\nof the work to develop this. Beth runs our strength\nand stability program in the practice. And basically I just tasked her with like, \"Hey go out to the\nliterature and come up with all of the best movements\nthat we think are proxies for what you need to be the most kick-ass, what we call Centenary decathlete.\" Which is the person living\nin their marginal decade, at the best.

        "description": "I was feeling pretty lost this year.",
        "text": "I was feeling pretty lost this year. See, I just wrapped up my first semester here at Harvard and I felt like while I had learned a lot academically, as a person I hadn't really learned a lot. I was still the same person that I was. I wasn't pursuing any passions and growing. I was just kind of, you know, being me and reacting to the world around me. And I was not happy with this. So I made a video about that and then I also decided that the New Year's resolution that I was going to be reading 52 books in 2018, one book every week. And about 20 books in, and I'm going to be real, it's changing my life. When I was a kid, I was a big book where I read books all the time. Harry Potter, a series of unfortunate events, and there's a game that whole series. I just, I love them. I can thank my mom for that because she's a published author. And, you know, this lasted for pretty much my entire elementary school career and then all of a sudden I fell out of love. It's not anything that really changed in me, but I cannot blame the school system for this. Okay? And here's why. The problem with the way that reading is approached in school is that it associates a reward with the act of reading. That is, if you read a book, then you do well in your presentation or on your test or on your essay. It turns it into a transaction. So now when you take away that reward of grades, well, you're doing what feels like work because previously you exchanged it for a reward, but now there is no reward. So it comes to choosing between, you know, reading or going on your phone or something else that's pleasurable. Well, you're going to choose going on your phone or doing something else because reading is a chore. It's work and there's no reward for that work. So when I started off reading a book every week, it was tough. It felt like a chore with no reward because that's how I've been trained by school. So I had to fight two issues. One motivation, which to fix honestly was just a matter of time. I just had to read a few books before I started to think, hey, this is really impactful. This is really fun. This is kind of starting to change my life. I'm seeing the world a little bit different. The lessons that I'm learning are actually starting to be applied to my life. I should keep doing this. This is pretty fun. And then it kind of became addictive. So then it just came to the question of how do I find enough time? And what I learned is that if I can carve out blocks of time throughout the day, so a little bit of time when I wake up, some time before I go to bed, sometimes I'll stick around after eating meals with my friends and I'll stick around for an extra 10, 15 minutes. If I have to take a bus somewhere, then I'll be reading on the bus. Just finding those little moments throughout the day. They really do add up and you can end up spending what an hour and a half, two hours every day. Just by picking those little 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there, and spending them reading as opposed to being on your phone or whatever. So I'm 20 weeks in and I feel like they've been some of the 20 best weeks in my life. Some of the 20 weeks where I've changed the most as a person. I mean it when I say that I feel like a different person and that it's changing my life because the way that I'm looking at the world is completely different. The way that I look at myself in the mirror, it's different. And that's really exciting to me because 20 weeks is not a very long time. I'm going to be in the grand scheme of things. So where am I going to be in another 20 weeks? And another 20 weeks. And another 20 weeks. If I can keep this habit up and I can keep this personal development going, that's really exciting to me. So I think it was mistakenly under the impression that I might not learn as much or much more from books than from, you know, watching videos on YouTube. But when you think about it, it actually makes a lot of sense why books are much more valuable than the time that you might spend on YouTube. And the reason being is simply that it takes somebody years to write a book in most cases, sometimes decades. And when you're looking at decades of work that have been condensed into a few hours of reading, that's pretty special. The ideas in there have been highly developed by someone who is really smart and who has thought about them a lot and you can kind of just absorb them. Whereas with a YouTube video or anything like that, while the ideas are still good, they've only been fleshed out for hours, maybe days. I mean, in the most extreme cases, weeks, but you would never see something that took years on YouTube. For the most part, it's just things that people create in a few days like this video. And I want to be clear that I'm not saying there is no value in other forms of media. Of course there's value in YouTube and Instagram and stuff like that. But reading books is just on another level. So I'm recommending that everybody picked this up. Like everybody should be reading for fun and the trust me at first is going to suck. If you've come through the school system, reading is going to feel like a chore, you just got to stay with it. You just got to keep pushing through it and kind of making yourself read until you start breaking that habit of, oh, this is a, this is a chore. Once you start realizing, wow, this is really rewarding. I'm getting cool lessons out of this that it becomes fun. And you just got to make sure that you're making time in your day, taking time away from social media if need be and just spending some time with books. It's going to be tremendously beneficial to you. So if I'm saying that the books that I've been reading have been changing my life, I should probably tell you what books they are. I have a list of them on my Amazon influencer pages. There's a link to that in the description of this video along with the other stuff that I use in my videos in my day to day life. I have kind of right them in order of the books that I've read this year that have been the most impactful personally to me. And there's kind of a wide variety of books, although they're mostly like positive psychology books, stuff like that. So if you're interested in that, check out the link in the description of this video. I've also included some other books on that list that I haven't read this year, but I've read in the past that have been really impactful. So let's talk about what's been happening on this channel recently because it's been nuts. Okay. When I posted my last video, I had I think 18,000 subscribers and now we're well over 30,000 and growing at like an incredible rate. It's been amazing to watch these numbers. I've been in finals mode kind of because I've had like four midterms in the past few days. It's been crazy and I haven't had a lot of types of dedicates making videos, which is too bad because I'm looking at these numbers. It's just incredibly inspirational that this many people are watching and following along and I really, I really do appreciate it. Thank you so much. I'm excited to be making, I've got some cool projects that are going to be coming up this summer. It's going to be fun. One of those projects is going to be building up my Instagram more. I'm going to start using it more and more for creating cool content, especially when I'm back home with my brother who is an amazing photographer. So if you're interested in following that along, if you don't already follow me on Instagram at the John Fish, there's going to be some cool stuff that you might not see otherwise. So thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video and I really do hope that you actually start reading more if you don't already read for fun. And if you do read and you have books that are not on my list yet, please drop a comment because I'm always looking for new books to read and I would love to hear from you. Thank you so much for watching. I will see you next Friday.",

        "title": "Why Tech Layoffs Don’t Reflect the Job Market | WSJ",
        "description": "The labor market is incredibly strong.",
        "text": "The labor market is incredibly strong. It might seem like Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's view of the labor market doesn't jibe with the leg off after layoff after layoff that is playing through the tech industry. However, he's right, at least according to the labor department's recent jobs reports. Employers added over 260,000 new positions in November, the 23rd month in a row, the economy has added them. And unemployment is under 4%. Near the lowest on record. So this is a great labor market in that sense. There's this huge disconnect. You're hearing about companies like Amazon, Twitter, DoorDash, layoff workers, and it feels like we're in the middle of a recession. Here's why those big headlines aren't in sync with the overall job market. First, some of the recent layoffs aren't yet reflected in the data. For example, about 1.4 million people were laid off or discharged from their jobs in November. But that number may not include the entire month. Some of the data does come with a lag. For example, some companies may have announced these layoffs too late in the month for them to be captured in the data. For example, DoorDash's cuts on November 30 weren't reflected in the report. Neither were Amazon's on the 16th. Or Carvana's on the 18th. Also, the labor department counts the layoffs themselves, not the announcements. Companies may be saying that they're going to tighten their belts and lay people off, but they simply haven't made those cuts quite yet. So that can lead to that lag. The delay might be part of the reason the unemployment rate has stayed. Near an all-time 50-year low, 3.7%. But there's more to it. The jobs market is in a really, really weird place right now. And there's this historic gap between the number of workers looking for employment and the number of jobs out there. That gap is partly driven by a shrinking workforce. The labor force participation rate, the number of people out there looking for jobs and wanting to have a job is historically low and actually ticked down in November. One reason why fewer people are looking is that millions left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in 2020. Roughly 2.6 million retired early. And more people were retired in 2020 than had in the previous eight years. Others left for reasons like lack of childcare. Now, there's about 1.7 job openings for every person looking for work. So what we're seeing is intense competition for workers right now, because you have this gap between the number of jobs out there and the number of people looking for jobs. And that helps add to this low unemployment rate. While COVID is affecting unemployment, tech layoffs aren't big enough to register. But data quirks are just one factor. Another is that the job cuts are proportionally smaller than the headlines might have you believe. Looking at the numbers, Amazon and meta-enounced layoffs of about 10,000 and 11,000 each. Snap said they've cut 1,200 jobs, Shopify cited 1,000, and Netflix estimated 300. In the entire sector, about 50,000 job cuts were announced in November. To put that into perspective, there are more than 150 million people working in the US. The entire tech industry is just 3% of the whole. You'd think it'd be companies in the S&P 500, the Meva-Cap companies driving job growth in the US. But in fact, it's the small businesses driving more of the job growth. Companies within the S&P 500 make up just 19% of employment in the US. To be sure, tech layoffs did count for a large proportion of November's job cuts. And this year, there were more than any year since 2002. So these tech companies are market leaders. They are some of the biggest companies in the US. If not the entire world. And they also loom large over the public consciousness. I mean, think about the phones that we use, the computers that we use, where we online shop. You know, they are leaders in so many different ways. However, they just don't make up as big of a part of the labor market as we think. Other sectors that lost jobs include retail and transportation and warehousing. But it's still unclear whether layoffs will continue in those sectors.

And as inflation remains high, additional layoffs will depend on how the job market reacts to Fed policy.",

        "text": "(crowd cheering) - [Harris] This is just a game, right? But it's not. It's really not. It's so much more than that. (upbeat music) I wanna show you a story that feels unique to our time in history. It's a story of how the organization that controls the sport that humans love most was hijacked by a tiny country that controls the resource\nthat humans need most. - [Reporter] Qatar wealth\nfrom oil and natural gas. - [Harris] Resulting in this. A world cup held in the desert, in a country built off fossil\nfuels and foreign labor with a citizen population\nthe size of Honolulu, Hawaii. (clock ticking) I wanna show you how this happened. How Qatar, this tiny country, beat out the US, Australia,\nJapan, and South Korea by convincing 14 of the\n22 most powerful men in football to vote for them to become the host of the 2022 World Cup. - [FIFA official] The winner to organize the 2022\nFIFA World Cup is Qatar. (crowd cheering) - Okay. This is a big story\nand I'm excited to dive in. But before we do, I need\nto thank today's sponsor. One of the most unique\nI've ever been a part of. Thank you Established Titles\nfor sponsoring today's video. So this is a custom in Scotland. That if you own land in Scotland, you are officially considered\na Lord or Lady or Laird. And this company, Established Titles, allows you to purchase a bit\nof land and become a Lord, which is something I've\nbeen shy to tell you, I have recently became. I may change my YouTube\nchannel to Lord Johnny Harris. And I expect anyone in the\ncomments to address me as Lord. Thank you. No, but seriously,\nEstablished Titles allows you to buy a plot of land in Scotland. You buy this, you get a plaque\nthat says you're a Lord. You can literally put this as your prefix on your credit card or your plane tickets. With every order, Established\nTitles plants a tree. They work with global charities\nto focus on deforestation. Like that's what's really going on here. Yes, this is a fun, novel, interesting way to say that you're a\nLord or to give a gift. In fact, I may gift this\nto my brother-in-law for Christmas and for the first 200 people who purchase a plot of land using the link in my description, you will be next to my plot. Like we will all have\nland together in Scotland. Right now, Established Titles is running\na massive Black Friday sale. You get an additional 10% off. So go to the link in my description. It's establishedtitles.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel. Use the code JOHNNYHARRIS and you'll get an additional 10% off. It's time to dive back\nin to this very deep, but very important story. Here we go. (ominous music) We've been deep in this. Trying to make a web. Trying to make a visual that\nwill help us understand FIFA and why this World Cup is being\nheld where it's being held. (slow electronic music) I wanna show it to you. And I've been really wrestling\nwith how to boil this down. And I think there's\njust three major things that we need to understand if we want to understand how\nQatar bought the World Cup. Check this out. Okay. There's three major things you have to understand to make sense of this story. They are FIFA. You have to understand the World Cup. And you have to understand Qatar. All right, this is our list. If you understand these\nthree things independently, you can put them together to determine what really happened here and how this tiny desert country ended up with the World Cup. So let's start with FIFA. (slow electronic music) FIFA was started by seven\nEuropean nations in 1904. The original goal here was\nto help organize matches for association football,\nwhich is football. It's the thing we all know. It's the game where\ntwo teams of 11 players try to kick a ball into a goal. Football was no means invented here at this time, at this place. People have been kicking a ball around for like a million years. But it was here in\nEurope in the early 1900s when the modern authority\nfor football was born and born in pretty humble beginnings. But FIFA quickly grew into a transnational\nquasi political authority that spans the whole globe. In fact, we have a map for that. (slow electronic music) So this is FIFA today. It is massive. It represents 211\ncountries or associations that all belong to this one\ngiant sporting organization. The most powerful, easily the most powerful sporting\norganization in the world. And it's got these six major\nregions or confederations. And it was the leaders from\nthese regional confederations who in 2010 sat on FIFA's\nexecutive committee, based here in Zurich, in this\nbunker-like headquarters. I was actually there just\na few weeks ago actually. I'm in Zurich. This is where the FIFA\nheadquarters, the FIFA museum are. This is where the votes happened. (slow electronic music) (crowd clapping) (announcer speaking foreign language) Okay, let's get back to this. Here we go. The 24 most powerful men in football. The ones who would go on to decide who would be the host\nof the 2022 World Cup. Here they are. They're just hanging out on our diagram sorted by their confederations. Sapp Blatter, the president\nright here at the top. Swiss guy. I'm gonna cross it off. I'm gonna cross it off the list. FIFA. We didn't go over all of it. There's obviously way more to FIFA than what I just talked about. The corruption, the scandals, all of it. But for the purposes of this video, we're just trying to answer the question how did Qatar end up with the World Cup? What we need to know is\nwhat we just talked about, the executive committee, the 24 most powerful men in football. I'm gonna cross it off the list. Next on our list, the World Cup. (upbeat music) So eventually FIFA got big enough to where they could put on a\nbig international tournament and people would actually come. They held it in Uruguay in 1930. 13 teams participated and\nthey called it the World Cup. It quickly became the most\nprestigious tournament in football and eventually would become the most viewed sports\nevent on the planet. (announcer screaming) Beating out even the Olympics if you consider that 1.1 billion people, like a decent chunk of the\nentire global population, were simultaneously watching in 2018 when France beat Croatia in\nthe World Cup final in Moscow. 1.1 billion people at the same time all watching the same thing. And I mean that's insane. But it's also kind of amazing. Like what other thing brings\nthat many people together? It is an amazing thing what\nglobal football has become. And that is basically thanks to FIFA. (mystical music) (announcers commentating) - Sport has the power to\ninspire and unite people. - I mean you, I'm immediately like, actually almost crying. Like this is, this is beautiful stuff. Look at this. Look at this guy. Look at this. These moments of like\namazing like performance and then this, the\nreaction of these crowds. But it must be noted that when you have this much\nattention on one event, 13% of the entire global\npopulation watching at one time, it will quickly become less\nabout the beauty of this game and more about, I mean, you\nknow what I'm gonna say, more about money. With so much attention, corporations pay endless money to get their logos\nanywhere near this stuff. Here or here or here. Okay, that's not that surprising. What blows my mind is how\nfar governments will go to also pay endless money to get anywhere near the World Cup. Not because they make money in\nreturn like the corporations. They always end up losing tons of money. But because there's a power in having the entire world\nfocused on your country for a few weeks. - Together, you've given\nthe American people an extraordinary opportunity to welcome the world to our shores as host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. - I mean, look at this. Look at this. We plotted this actually. We found this data. Every four years is a World Cup. And this is how much each of\nthese countries have spent on their World Cup. These are again, taxpayer money here. This is government money being invested into hosting the World Cup. Throw this sucker onto a bar chart and you get something like this. Like it's getting out of hand. Like every year, they spend\nmore and more and more. Oh, and spoiler alert, wait till I show you this\ngraph with Qatar in the mix. Minds will be blown. I can promise you that. (electronic music) The point is that countries are willing to pay more and more to get\nthe World Cup in their country. A moment for them to put\ntheir best foot forward on a global stage. This is what we like to call soft power. Okay. I am crossing the\nworld cup off of our list. Not because I covered every angle of it, but because for the\npurposes of this story, this is what matters. Countries are more and more\nwilling to pay unlimited amounts of money to try to get\nthis event in their country because a billion people\nare gonna watch it. It makes them look good. Okay? We're crossing it off. All right, onto the last\npiece of our puzzle. Qatar, a country that\nshould be pronounced Ga-tar, but I'm not gonna be that pretentious guy who shows up trying to like say it in the local pronunciation cuz it makes me sound cultured and cool. I am that guy. I'm trying to not be that guy. So for now, I'm just going to say it like a Texas\noilman says it, Qatar. Okay? Thanks. (slow electronic music) I'm gonna be really quick\non this history of Qatar. Like we're not going into\nthe full thing, okay? This is a very juicy history that I could easily do\na whole video about. I'm gonna give you the sparknotes, which is that Qatar,\nfor most of its history, was populated by nomadic\ntribes and fishing villages whose biggest industry was pearl diving, which is like, a pretty\ngnarly thing to do. Like you like tie a rock around your ankle and go under to find clams\nand then open the clams and see if there's pearls. It was like hard work. The British eventually swooped in because the industrial\nrevolution was happening and they smelled oil over here. Qatar becomes a British\nprotectorate until 1971 when they became an independent country and Islamic constitutional monarchy, run by one family dynasty. So by the seventies,\nthe British were gone. But crucially, the oil was not. And because of said oil, Qatar quickly transitioned from a poor tribal society to a globally connected energy\nhub with unlimited money. This accelerated in the seventies when Qatar won the fossil fuel lottery and discovered that they just happened to be sitting on the largest\nknown natural gas field on the planet. This guy. They share a bit of it with the territorial waters of Iran, but most of it is theirs. (slow electronic music) Oh, and by the way, all this fossil fuel and\nthe revenue coming from it belongs to this teeny country, which this is a very teeny country. Like we're talking about a country that fits inside of the\nsole of the boot of Italy. Look at this. I mean it doesn't totally fit. It's like, but it's tiny. And we're talking about a few\nhundred thousand Qataris here. This isn't a big population and yet they're all getting in on this unbelievable amount of wealth. Like we can't fathom how rich this teeny little thumb shaped country is. They could not spend\ntheir money fast enough. They didn't have enough\nlabor to build all the stuff that they had money for. So they started to import\nlabor from other countries. 95% of the people who live\nand work here are not Qataris. They're expats from other places. 95%. Meanwhile, the teeny population that are actually Qatari\ncitizens live very good lives. They're some of the richest\npeople on the planet. Most of them work very\ncushy government jobs that pay really well. They live in a welfare state\nwhere their needs are met because there is just unlimited money for everyone in this country. Okay, that's Qatar. (upbeat music) So this is the moment\nwhere the three pieces of our puzzle come together. Because in the nineties, Qatar starts to read the tea leaves. They start to realize that\nthe world is gonna move away from fossil fuels, the\none thing that they have. Their gravy train is gonna come\nto an end in a few decades. It's time to prepare for\nthe future, said Qatar, by investing their billions and billions, hundreds of billions of extra dollars into anything and everything\nthat is not fossil fuels. Diversify. So they start to go nuts. Everything from real estate\nin Singapore and New York City to buy the St. Petersburg\nAirport in Russia to buying Miramax Films and the Italian luxury brand Valentino. Like, boy, should I just\nmake an entire video on Qatar Investment Authority? Cuz that would be juicy. In 2017, the BBC noted\nthat Qatar owns more land in the UK than the Queen does. And as a part of this big diversifying strategic\ninvestment effort, Qatar focused on turning their country into a global hub for\nprestigious international events. You see where I'm going with this? Lucky for them, there is a shortcut to the most prestigious\nevent in the world. The World Cup. (upbeat music) Oh, and this event happens\nto be run by an organization that speaks a language that\nthey're very familiar with. The language of money\nand power and influence. And here's where we are. (slow electronic music) So we're back here to this web. These gatekeepers of\ninternational football, the people who voted on who was gonna host the 2022 World Cup. 14 of these guys voted Qatar. And I want to know why. Qatar, a country that FIFA itself, when they were evaluating all\nthe bidders for the hosting, decided was not super suited for this. There's all these parameters that countries should\nhave to be a good host. Qatar didn't really have a lot of 'em. And in fact, they had the opposite. Super hot weather. No widespread football infrastructure. And perhaps most strikingly, not a huge tradition of football or even a significant local population to spread football to in their place. Like they have a couple\nhundred thousand people. The World Cup is supposed to\nbring football to new regions and spread it throughout a country. How are they gonna do\nthat in a hot desert oasis with like 300,000 people? So let's do this. We're done with our list. Let's move on to the\nnext part of this video, which is probably the part\nwe put the most effort into. And I want you to stick with me here because the point isn't to\ngo into every single detail of how some of this corruption went down. No one's gonna remember\nevery little detail. That's not the point. The point is to give you a\nsampling of the mechanics of how influence and power works. Not just in FIFA, but in the\ninternational system generally. How powerful people get what they want. We'll never know for certain\nbecause this vote was secret. But we know Qatar got 14 of these guys. And I think I have a\npretty good idea of how for most of them. (slow electronic music) We're gonna start with this guy. This is Mohammed Bin Hammam. He's one of the executive\ncommittee members and he's from Qatar. Okay. We can safely assume\nthat he probably voted for his own country. But more importantly, it was him, a big wig, international football guy who helped pull the strings\non everyone else on this web starting with this guy. Jack Warner. He's an executive committee member from Trinidad and Tobago. Leaked emails and bank records obtained by the Sunday Times revealed\nthat before the vote, Bin Hammam deposited $450,000 directly into Warner's account. And later even more,\ntotalling $1.6 million. Just like literally,\nlike he just paid him. Like that's, this is the simplest version. Just like I will pay you money to give to, so you do what I want you to. It's just like so straightforward. No wonder a month after\nthe vote, in an email, Warner called his Qatari\ncolleague Bin Hammam, quote, \"the only brother I have in football.\" Okay. One guy down. Who else? Next, we have the three\nexecutive committee members from the South American Confederation. The US Department of\nJustice has gotten involved with these guys. They recently released\nan unsealed indictment against all three of them, alleging that these three were quote, \"offered and received bribes\nin exchange for their votes.\" I mean, it's pretty unsatisfying. We don't have the evidence\nthat the DOJ is using for this case, but\nthey're building a case. Oh, and by the way, two of these guys just died in like the past couple of years. Next up, we've got these three guys from the African Confederation. A year before the vote, the African Confederation was\nhaving their annual meeting in Angola, which by the way, was paid for by the Qatar bid team. The people who were like\ntrying to convince people to vote for the World Cup. They paid for the whole thing. Okay. I get it. Trying to lobby for your team. That's fine. But here's where it gets shady. While they were at this meeting, the Qatar bid team met with these three executive\ncommittee members. And according to a former employee who was in the room translating, the Qataris offered 1.5\nmillion dollars each to these guys in exchange\nfor their promise that they would vote for Qatar. A year later, this employee turned\nwhistleblower actually went back on her statement, saying that\nshe actually lied about it and that there were no bribes. Kind of fishy. What's your incentive to lie? But then the FBI showed\nup at her front door and she admitted that she was pressured to say that she had lied about it and that actually the bribes happened. I don't know, man. We don't like... I side with the whistleblower. You can decide how you feel. And now her life is basically ruined. She said in an interview that quote, - I will always look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. - Oh, okay. And while\nwe're talking about this, one of those three guys that apparently got 1.5 million dollars was later filmed by undercover reporters negotiating an $800,000 bribe\nin exchange for his vote. Like smoking gun evidence. Same thing happened to this guy, the executive committee member\nfrom the Oceania region. And they actually got\ndisqualified from voting. So these two guys didn't actually vote. So we're now down to 22 exco members. Let's keep going. (slow electronic music) Okay, so we've gone over the instances where there was direct money given in exchange for the promise to vote. The next phase of the story\nare more subtle versions of influence. Less overt. Less smoking gunnish. Like this guy from Thailand. He's the executive committee\nmember from Thailand. Four months before the vote, Thailand and Qatar were\nrenegotiating an energy deal. Thailand was trying to get a better price for their natural gas, something Qatar has a lot of. But for some reason, this guy, a FIFA executive committee\nvoting member was at the meeting. Wait, what? Why is this football guy in the room while there's these big\ngas negotiations going on? Yes, I'm being coy. We know where this is going. I mean, you gotta read\nthese leaked emails. They're so juicy. You've got a FIFA guy\nemailing a Qatar gas guy from Qatar Petroleum. They're talking about the development of their two football associations from their different countries and then saying that they're gonna liaise with the CEO of the gas company to follow up about a\nliquid natural gas sale. I mean, it's just so clear\nwhat's going on here. Favorable terms of the\ndeal in exchange for, \"Hey dude, make sure to\nvote for our country.\" (slow electronic music) Oh, and who was this meeting between the gas guy and\nthe FIFA guy arranged by? You guessed it. This guy, Mohammed Bin Hammmam, the executive committee member from Qatar who's pulling all these strings. Oh, by the way, just a\nlittle side note here. Going through these leaked emails, I couldn't help but notice\nthat the FIFA guy's email was sour_piggy@ redacted. (chuckles) Sour piggy? Sour piggy. Sour piggy's doing a lot of corruption. Okay. (chuckles) - [Cameraman] I'm cutting, dude. - Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then there's a few just like, sort of circumstantial ones that give you a flavor of how this works. Like this guy who sold his family's land to Qatar a year after the\nvote for 27 million pounds, which was like way over asking price. And this executive committee member whose son was given a job\nat a private Qatari hospital shortly after the World Cup vote. Both of these guys, of course, like everyone else on this list, denies any connection,\nthat this was influenced. But now we're at the most\nsignificant moment in all of this. The thing that really tipped\nthe scales for the vote. And it has to do with this confederation. The most powerful, the\nEuropean Confederation. Specifically this guy, Michel Platini. A former French football\nplayer turned FIFA guy. He was the president\nof this confederation, which inevitably meant that he has sway over these other dudes. Just one week before the\nvote, like crunch time, Platini got an invitation\nthat he couldn't refuse. A luncheon with the French\npresident at his palace. Platini later said that\nbefore this meeting, he was planning on voting for the US to host the World Cup in 2022. But he goes to this luncheon\nand who else is there? No big deal. Just these two guys, the\nmost powerful dudes in Qatar. One of them, the prime minister of Qatar and the other, the current Emir of Qatar from like the old dynasty family. It's important to\nremember the context here. Like what's happening. This is 2010. The world has just been rattled by a global financial meltdown and the president of France, Sarkozy, is stressed and he's in the room with the leaders of Qatar who are not nearly in the\nsame financial trouble. See the section before\nabout unlimited amounts of money thanks to fossil fuels. And it's clear that these\nQataris want something. Something that the Frenchmen\nin the room can deliver them. A vote for their country\nto host the World Cup. Something they really want. According to sources\nclose to this meeting, Sarkozy flat out told\nPlatini to vote for Qatar. Why? Well, we'll never know. But it's clear that he wanted\na few things from Qatar. In this same meeting, Sarkozy told the Qatari\nthat he wanted Qatar to buy the French football\nteam Paris Saint-Germain, which happens to be Sarkozy's\nfavorite football team. And at the time was in financial ruin. After this meeting, a few\nimportant things happened. Number one, Qatar did end\nup buying that football team for 60 million pounds\njust like Sarkozy wanted. They turned it around and soon\nit became a star studded team with merch that's worn by the world's most popular celebrities. And then we suddenly see an uptick in big trade deals\nbetween Qatar and France. Qatar Airways buys 50\ngiant planes from Airbus, the giant French airplane maker. I mean, if you look at what\none of these planes cost in 2010, times it by 50, we're looking at 18 billion dollars. A massive deal. And in the end, Platini in this room with his president telling him\nto do what the Qatari want. We need them right now. And it worked. Michel Platini flipped his\nvote from the USA to Qatar. He admitted it later. That's not even speculation. The president of the executive\ncommittee, Sapp Blatter, was pissed about this and later said that this\nwas the defining moment for Qatar winning. - They have influenced Michel Platini at that time to vote for Qatar. - Because remember, Platini then went back to his European Confederation with eight executive committee\nmembers, eight votes, and he almost certainly\ninfluenced others to join him. One book I read claims that\nhe took four votes with him. But we'll never know. And then on a cold day\nin December of 2010, the day of the vote came. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] The 2022 FIFA World Cup. - [Harris] So on that faithful\nday in the winter of 2010 in Zurich, all the guests arrive\nbecause it was voting day. - Every- - Clearly, I think we had\nabsolutely fantastic bid. - Well, we got a great bid,\nso we just gotta go in there and give it everything that we've got. - These 22 men cast their\nvotes in multiple rounds until a majority victor emerged. At least 11 of them voted\nfrom Qatar since round one. And finally, 14 votes\nwere delivered to Qatar, a majority and almost\ndouble what the USA got. (dramatic music) So yeah, that's how it went down. That's how it went down. Like, look, we'll never\nknow exactly what happened. A lot of this stuff we\nknow because it leaked out and we were able to put it all together. But the fact is every one of\nthese men has been involved in some corruption investigation. I mean, it's no surprise\nthat this stuff happened and probably so much more. FIFA is corrupt to the core. Qatar didn't make this happen. Qatar just saw an organization\nthat spoke their language, the language of unlimited money, and they used that to\nget what they wanted. To prepare for the future, to diversify, to get the world to look at them. - [Announcer] It is the\nbiggest event in the world. - So no, this isn't just a game. The reason why all of this matters is because football can be a beautiful thing. No matter what language someone speaks or their politics or\ntheir God or whatever, they have this universal\nlanguage, this game. A global culture full of\nscreaming and cheering and crying and pride and identity. It's ridiculous, yet so\nbeautiful, so uniquely human. And in a very real way, football\nis a mirror to the world. What's acceptable here in\nthis most revered sport is what's acceptable everywhere. So by using money and\ninfluence to get the bid for the World Cup, Qatar showed us just how\npower works in our world. They showed us who really\nmatters and who doesn't and validated an old idea that the rules of fair\nplay don't really matter if you have enough money. (slow melancholy music) Hey, thanks for watching and for sticking around\ntill the end of the video. This is just the first\nof two videos we made on this topic. The next video publishes soon and it's kind of the next\nchapter of the story. What happens after Qatar\ngets hold of the World Cup and they have to build\nall this infrastructure. And it's a very long, intense journey that I go on to report that story and I kind of tell the story\nof that reporting experience. So that will be out soon. I wanna tell you about a couple ways that you can support our journalism here. We do these deep dives. They take a lot of effort\nand we need support not just from sponsors, but more and more from the community. We have a community called \"The Newsroom\", which is over on Patreon, and it is a place where you can get an\nextra video every month. It is a behind the\nscenes vlog of everything that happens in this\nstudio behind the scenes. The fun, the wild, the\ndeep dives, the animation, the editing, the team, the whole universe that exists behind the camera. I'm just one cog of a very big machine that we're building here. You also get access to my scripts, to interviews that I do with experts that are just like the\nfull length interview. Have influence on thumbnails and titles and even story ideas. So go check out \"The\nNewsroom\" over on Patreon. The link is in my description. If you're a video person\nor a photo person, we also have lots of presets that we use to color\nour videos and photos. We developed these over\nthe course of a year with a professional colorist. They're very wonderful\nand purchasing those, you can use them and they also\nhelp support us over here. So those are a couple\nways that you can support if you'd like to. Thank you for watching this video and subscribe if you haven't already. I will see you very soon in\nthe continuation of this story. See you.",

        "text": "a while back I made a video about Bayes rule and explained how it had been influential in my thinking I didn't really however explain how Bayes rule works or what it is so I'm gonna do that today I'll start with a puzzle imagine that you're walking across the campus of some large American University and you meet a guy let's call him Tom you chat with Tom for a few minutes and you notice that tom is shy he's not really making eye contact very often he's some mumbling and my question for you is if you had to guess would you guess that tom is more likely to be in a math ph.d program or in the business school let's assume it has to be one or the other so I don't know what you guessed but I've taught a class on Bayes rule a bunch of time so I can tell you what most people guess and that is that tom is more likely to be a math PhD student the reasoning is that shyness is just much more common in math PhDs than in business schools and I think this is accurate based on my experience there's an old joke that goes how can you tell the extroverted mathematician and the answer is he's the one looking at your shoes instead of his shoes anyway so I think that observation is accurate but there's another piece of information that's relevant and that people tend to forget when answering this question and that is how many math PhDs are there relative to distance school students there's a lot fewer the numbers will vary from school to school but it's something on the order of ten times as many business school students as math PhD students so we have these two pieces of information about there being many more business students than math students and also about shyness being more common among math students than business students and the question is how do we combine these two pieces to get one overall estimate about Tom this is where Bayes rule comes in so you can imagine that this divided rectangle represents the relative proportions of math to business students very roughly speaking we'll put it at one to ten and now looking just at math students we can ask how common is shyness I would very roughly guess that it's about 75% of math PhD students come off as shy and now looking just at business school students again guessing roughly I'd say about 15% of business school students come off as shy so now we've represented both of those pieces of information in one diagram and we want to know whether tom is more likely to be in a math program or a business program we don't know which one he's in but we do know that he's shy which means that he must be in one of those lavender rectangles right because those represent the shy math and the shy business students so to get a sense of the relative probabilities of him being in math versus business we just have to compare the relative sizes of those lavender rectangles and it looks roughly like the lavender business rectangle is about twice as big as the lavender math rectangle and you can see how the math shakes out we just multiplied two linear ratios the ratio of math to business students which we put at one to ten times the ratio of shyness in math versus shyness in business which we put it 75 215 and multiplying those two linear ratios gives us a ratio of areas which comes out to about one to two so roughly twice as likely for Tom to be in the business program even though shyness is more common among math students so this is the mechanics of Bayes rules how it works and now I want to talk about how I use it in my everyday thinking I don't plug numbers into a formula I almost never draw these diagrams in fact but there are a few rules principles of thinking that fall out of the math of Bayes rule that that are really useful for me principle number one is something like remember your priors so as you saw in the Tom example what people naturally do is focus on the evidence that tom is shy and forget about the prior the sort of background knowledge that math is just a much less common major or program than business and this is a very common phenomenon it's called base rate neglect and a personal example I have many examples of this myself but one example comes recently from I I rented a house with some friends and while we were there we had to call a repairman to fix the stove and he made us a little bit nervous because while he was there we noticed him sort of peering into different rooms of the house and there's no reason you would need to see the bedroom of a house if you're here to fix the stove so we had heard stories in which repairmen come back after having done their repairs and robbed a house after having had a chance to you know case the joint or whatever and so we were worried that that was what was going on in this case and I think that seeing the repairman's snooping is some evidence that should make you somewhat more confident that he's going to rob you but we had to take a step back and remember what is the prior on a repairman being honest versus a robber and I think that it's not that common for someone to be a robber I don't know the exact numbers but maybe there are a hundred times more honest repairmen than robbers something on that order so even imagining that snooping is much more common among robbers than honest repair men let's say 80% of robbers will be seen to be snooping and maybe 10% of honest repair men even so seeing that evidence should only bump our probability of this guy wanting to rob us from maybe 1% to maybe 8 percent so you know we should lock our doors but not freak out something like that so that's principle number one remember your priors principle number two I'll illustrate with a another story from my life a while ago I was working with a guy named let's call him Bob and I had reason to believe that Bob might be jealous of or competitive with another person who worked with us let's call her Alice so one day I'm having coffee with Bob and he's complaining about Alice I think because she hadn't finished some projects that she was supposed to have finished by that point and I'm thinking to myself this just proves that I was right about Bob if he was jealous of he would want to make her look bad and he's complaining about her so I'm right and a little while later it occurred to me to ask well okay let's assume for the moment that I'm wrong and Bob is not jealous of Alice how implausible is it really in that scenario that he would be complaining about her and it's not unplanned plausible at all actually it often happens that people get annoyed when someone doesn't finish something that they were supposed to finish and it doesn't have anything to do with being jealous are competitive and so I may still have my prior reasons to suspect that Bob is probably jealous of or competitive with Alice but seeing this new piece of evidence should not make me feel significantly more confident that I'm right maybe complaining about Alice is a little bit more likely in the world in which he's jealous of her than in the world in which he's not but only slightly it should not really shift my probability that much at all that I was right and I think that this is a very common thing as well that we go around the world seeing pieces of evidence that we can explain with our current theory with our pet theory and that makes us feel all the more confident that were right and we don't take that extra step of asking well what if I were wrong what would I expect to see then and how different is it if at all from what I see now so I keep this principle in mind when let's say I try some new diet and I notice that I have more energy this week well how likely is that in the world in which the diet doesn't work compared to the world which it does maybe my energy is really very variable so it's not really that implausible that my energy would happen to be higher right after trying the diet or let's say I give someone a paper or an idea to evaluate and he thinks it's great I have to ask myself well how common is it for him to think that bad ideas are great how much evidence is his approval that my idea is in fact great so that's principle number two ask yourself what if I were wrong what would I expect to see and how is it different from what I currently see pencil number three is sort of the flipside of principle number two you could you could call would update incrementally so another story when I first moved to Berkeley I was pretty confident that meditation was for lack of a better word fake and so I was surprised when I when one of my friends that I met in Berkeley who's very smart and thoughtful he raved about meditation and said it had made him much happier as a person and I think it's very easy to explain this evidence away by saying well there's a placebo effect there he expected meditation to work and so he felt that it did or maybe there was something else in his life that changed around the time he started meditating and that was actually making him happier not the meditation and I think both of these stories are totally plausible but I have to admit that it seems at least a little bit more likely that my smart thoughtful friend would report benefits from meditation in the world in which meditation is real than in the world in which it's not and so maybe I shouldn't change my mind significantly about whether meditation works or not but it should it should update my probability a little bit towards meditation being real and if I encounter additional pieces of small-to-medium-sized evidence as time goes on all of which are more likely in the world in which meditation works than the world in which it doesn't I should gradually you know change my mind maybe there will be a tipping point where cumulatively it's just more likely overall that meditation works than that it doesn't given all the evidence I've encountered and I think it's important to pay attention to these these snowflakes of evidence that maybe weigh very little on their own but if you pay attention to them and notice how they accumulate gradually their their collective weight becomes enough to break a tree branch so that's principle number three update incrementally and I hope that you've gotten some sense now for Bayes rule how it works the intuition behind it and and how it can be useful and informing your thinking I don't think that it's the be-all end-all of how to think about everything as some people hold it up to be but I do think it's a really essential framework for thinking about what believe how confident to be and how to shift your beliefs as you encounter new information about the world you",

        "text": "All right, we're not doing this. Because that's all my back and my last don't feel that as much basically I'm doing like at this point now I'm basically doing a vertical roll and if our goal is to build our Width then we need to be as upright as we can. I keep our shoulders from retracting Pulled-outs is this is our aggression to a pull-up, right? Pull-up, how many people here can you pull up? Right. How many people can do ten pull-ups? Okay, show me a pull-up. Someone pulling the pull-up. All right, we're gonna do a pull-up Relax there, so see all this here cool like a c So there are taries, tars major, right here. This is what's doing the big pull here relax All right, so cool thing here is like if I was gonna if I was coaching well and he used if you wanted to get a bodybuilder We got a lot of room in here. We need to build up so if you're looking at you know what we're Can you take a shirt off? I'll take a shirt off please. Thank you very much. I swear you only had for a bit of a gut I'm sorry. All right, so if we're looking at all right when the guys leave is what comes So we're looking at development if we're looking at like you know what we're trying to build if we're looking again Sacrifice I personally were trying to change our physique we have good development here crazy amount of Activation here mid-trapped upper trap almost like non-existent. All right, it's not nice It's but like it's obviously something isn't target now in terms of like what we want to build and for looking at building this part So I mean as a coach me like okay if you want a bodybuilder You want to make your big your back bigger or more balanced? Rose is gonna do this part of your body and your lats too But more so if I want to really get this to build I'll need to row so do a rowing motion So right what pulls this and you can see how much how little this part is and I can see I see bone but I can feel a little more bone here because this it obviously is not doing you don't do many rows Do you? No, no, really yeah, right and he's on a bike too. So a lot of his thing is this So he's really strong in here. So when we're doing pulls vertical pulls so do if his raising hands or just touch the bar Vertical pulls is this like a little smiley face to see here so depends right back there you go good So right here this is what's pulling this thing down your lats attach Right to your arm in here and then to a couple ribs whatever and then to your hip So basically like it's basically like 90% of your entire back is like lats, right? This part of your tarry's tarry's major minor this pulls this arm down like this or It does this So if I want to get this wider I need to do things where he's pulling himself from this position If I want to get this thing bigger I need him to do Rose or do a hinge or bent over row That's where we're trying to get bigger from there. That's how we're building this right so do a pull up So from here I'm greeting the chest to the bar not trying to get my chin over Because when we get when we get chin over we try to get the whole rolling itself forward here So my cue is always bringing their chest to the bar. There you go. That's it now We don't have to go the high, but it's really good either way relax the regression to this is this because it's the exact same movement All in thing is is you're getting help you're getting help from here to pull yourself down It's the exact same motion As is doing that there so if you can't get there or if your goal is to get there It's to aggressive here to get strong as you can here then to move there again like another question That would be definitely like using resistors bands or Mississippi pull up both risk for the sake of just like really being able to focus just on our lots Moving let's get in this right here. We're going to do we're gonna work ourselves up And this is what we're really gonna focus on and really like showing you guys what a hard set feels like We're saying thing like over here, but here's me a little easier because we can just pin some weight And I'm gonna make guys hurt so whatever you guys think you did before start off with that as a warm up We're gonna do 10 to 15 reps right we're sticking that 30 45 seconds And I want you guys to pick away that you would kind of like on your progression to your heart set So your first let's not gonna be a hard set. I want your first set to be a coach I'm gonna coach you guys all up. Okay, get him now. I want flat back straight backs. I don't want lean back. There you go And we're gonna start and And go Control rep down Control down control up good pull On you can chow it up Pull down fast wrap your hand around the entire bar There you go. We're pretty strong pull. You can actually think we'll pull those elbows to the side of your body Good straight back Good Shoe down good Literally like what do the hand positioning do when you do pulls we're necessarily don't need This part of our arm to do this movement really we don't we see so kind of a load to just do this Sholar reflection one word when we supinate or Pronate or whatever it's just gonna give us in some terms one part of is it's gonna Give us like what kind of bicep help I'm not gonna get from being either Pronated neutral Super-rated kind of related back to doing bicep price of curls. What's the easiest way to bicep curl? Probably hammer or supinated you're gonna get a lot more you know bicep involved But if I'm doing hammer on to get the brachialis brachia in the brach radiois so I were getting a lot So when I'm pulling this is probably my strongest way to pull right same with dumbbells I'm probably pulling a lot more this way than I'm gonna this way right if I supinate right if I'm doing supination and pulling This one's gonna evolve a little bit more back Because for me to do this supination and In this position and up here it involves external rotation and my tarry's minor helps with external rotation So my tarry's minor is that part of their back again where I show and will so if I'm in this position here I'm exposing a lot more of that of that tarry's muscle here It's being involved a lot more there's a lot more of a load press on it But that's we're gonna get now if we're doing like pronated You're using a lease amount of bicep in a sense you think about it right? You think of like a verse curl. It's hard you can't do like you know verse curl is a lot harder than is this in this way Right, but regardless of what it's still pulling this like this right just didn't have what kind of bicep I'm gonna get now when we're doing this and making it easier not easier, but it's more optimal When I'm pulling with this I don't want to just be kind of pulling here because a lot of times we just get this part of our hand pulling I want to almost feel this part I'm trying to bend this thing in half Like this way, but I'm not trying to do it where now my elbows are like this much I'm trying to do that I'm trying to do this so my lats pull in so I'm pulling in and move straight down Right just a little bit like this it's the exact same thing as if this as if I was pressing Right the same thing and the same thing as the overhead press so we did it over at press here's your pull down Here's your overhead press pull down overhead press or the trade tune you're doing this This is this is not here just to keep you in place It's to give you a little bit of leverage and help so if you want to give yourself a little more help Push your toes in the ground when you're pulling It will make this tighter and it'll keep you a lot more leverage Let's do it again good a good weight and go Good. I want you leaning back put yourself out of that bench a little bit sit back a little more of the bench Control that wrap tight core pull Two and one good When I'm doing a pulvey guys watch right I am again Don't go crazy now guys When I'm in this position I'm engaging my core so I can stay this way Right pull me up. Thanks bro Right so I don't my core being engaged is keeping me from doing this Right I don't want to do this See all my see what happens with my stomach. I'll do this it loosens up Right I'm hyper extending my back my core is gonna flex my back So to keep it up straight so when I do move it looks more so like I'm doing more of this Not this Right is a big difference to me doing this and this I'm a hinging exactly keep things consistent so what I'm here just like an overhead press I'm from here Right we're not doing this Because that's all my back and my last don't feel it as much basically I'm doing like at this point now I'm basically doing a vertical rope and if our goal is to build our Width then we need to be as upright as we can I keep our shoulders from retracting when I'm here I'm not retracting this is retracting we're here. I'm not so doing a set each one whoever We're not not gonna set yet finish off load that up right here. That's where I want to feel it good I don't want to feel this moving too much at all good watch those traps Keep the chops down pull up there you go",

        "text": "hey friends welcome back to healthy grocery girl today I'm sharing with you three healthy coffee alternatives that give you energy if you're new to our channel welcome my name is Megan and I'm a registered dietician nutritionist and the founder of healthy grocery girl we have our YouTube channel website we're on social media you can follow me on instagram at healthy grocery girl and here in our youtube channel we share healthy recipes wellness and healthy living inspiration so if you liked today's video make sure to give this video a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe for more videos so today we're talking all about coffee alternatives not everyone drinks coffee or maybe you do drink coffee and you really love it but you want to wean yourself off of coffee and maybe introduce some other options that can still give you that energy you're looking for but are also going to maybe not be as dehydrating or also just pack in more nourishing ingredients the first coffee alternative is matcha matcha is pure green tea leaves ground into a fine powder it is packed with antioxidants and is more potent than steeped green tea matcha contains caffeine and l-theanine a natural substance which can calm the body at the same time because matcha is a very fine ground powder it can be difficult to stir into liquid with just a spoon you can buy a matcha bowl and whisk or like me simply use a milk frother which heats and mixes the matcha powder and your non-dairy milk at the same time enjoy matcha warm or chilled plain or sweetened as you would prefer the second coffee alternative is brewed cocoa beans specifically the brand that I like is called creo brew and the taste reminds me of a little bit of a watered-down hot chocolate but it's still that warm comforting beverage experience you would get with a cup of coffee and it does give you a little boost of energy my preferred brew ratio for Creole brew is 1/3 of a cup of grounds with 16 ounces of boiling water in a French press stir with a wooden spoon and let steep for 10 minutes then plunge and enjoy as it is or you can add a splash of coconut milk [Music] the third healthier coffee alternative is to make yourself a big green juice whether you make it at home or you pick up cold-pressed organic juice from a tea shop but juice is so nourishing it's really hydrating and a common sign of dehydration is low energy levels so if you're feeling sluggish and like you don't have a lot of energy you need to hydrate drink more water and a green juice is also a really great way to hydrate Plus green juices are packed with fruits and vegetables full of vitamins minerals and antioxidants this is one of my favorite green juice recipes and it's from my book the five-day juicing diet if you didn't know I wrote a book and it's called the five-day juicing diet and it's packed with juice recipes but also real food recipes so the five-day diet it's not a cleanse sort of detox where all you drink is juice for five days there are juice recipes and smoothies and meals and snacks are gonna sip you're gonna munch you're gonna eat it's going to be delicious so if you're interested in learning more about my book the five-day juicing diet I'll put a link below in the video description box to make this recipe you will need rainbow chard romaine lettuce green apple pineapple dandelion greens cucumber fresh cilantro and ginger start by prepping all of your ingredients you may want to wash or peel some of these fruits and veggies then cut the ingredients in decisis appropriate for your juicer then you'll feed all the ingredients through the juicer and enjoy within one hour [Music] well that's it for today's video I hope you guys learn something new and this video is helpful for you if you're looking for coffee alternatives thanks so much for watching thanks so much for subscribing to our channel we love you we hope you're having a great day and we'll see you in the next video bye [Music]",

        "text": " So is this is this your first meal of the day? It's now almost six o'clock. It will be yeah Really? Yeah, no breakfast no lunch. No because well because it's it's clear based on thousands of years of human existence that Eating less is if it's not starvation amount of nutrition, it's good for you because why? Well, so we didn't know why it was good for you We thought that it was slowing down metabolism, but it's not not the case What's happening is it's turning on when I'm not eating or if you choose not to eat for a meal or to You're turning on the body's defenses against aging in our labs. We always have Calluric restricted animal. Okay, you take brothers two groups one eat whatever they want the other get 60% of that and They leave 40% longer and healthier and people and we know it for since the 1950s But people assumed that that means that you give less for breakfast lanchen dinner you just eat less throughout the day It's a positive, but that's not what it is though, right? No If we actually are giving them all the food throughout the day They're thinner, but they don't leave longer So you need the fasting to upregulate the mechanism for aging well the the trick to longevity is a term called Hormesus which is a little bit of stress on your body biological stress a running bit of hunger Cold heat Put your body in a state of perceived adversity So you don't have to hurt yourself, but you put your body in a Kind of a scared state on my goodness I could die if this continues and then they turn on these defenses against aging So we have these genes that get turned on Some of them that we work on a cold search to them and so by being hungry We've shown that you turn these on and then your body defends itself if you sit around you eat constantly They don't then at work very hard really and your clock ticks faster when your body Under goes a very mild stressor. We're not talking about a major stressor It actually becomes a little more resilient So it's kind of this what doesn't kill you makes you stronger so these kind of really acute mild stressors It actually can boost the resilience of your biology and we think that things like fasting or Chloric restriction is actually acting through that and also same thing with exercise exercises actually stressor on the body But we think it's actually the body's response to this. This is what we get what gives it the benefit So you've been doing this now for a long time. What do you what do you do personally? I'd eat a plant-based diet and I try to do what's called intermittent fasting Again, the science is still out on whether this is having a big impact I try to kind of restrict the time I eat during the day to About six hours and then fast the rest of the day I usually eat my first meal at like One in the afternoon so around lunch time, but maybe a little later lunch And then I try and make sure I don't eat anything in past 8 p.m So I basically Brush my teeth when my daughter's going to bed and that's it and do you do it for your family as well I definitely don't do it for my daughter. I don't think Individuals who are still growing should be practicing either chloro-crestriction or any type of kind of dietary intervention My husband's not in favor that he's a big New York big a lover It's not willing to give that up trying to fast like I do Right out of the gate is really tough. You know should ease into it or you'll fail. You notice the difference Ah, it's in my diet or in my health just in the way you feel. Oh, yeah, definitely. I feel sharper I'm not feeling bloated anymore. I don't feel full of meals. Yeah Try one meal a day drink coffee drink tea drink water fill up your stomach You'll get used to that give it at least two weeks for your body to get used to it and your liver just start making its own sugar and Then try tried lunch as well and you might find that you've never felt better look better Being able to concentrate better during the day and even sleep better",

        "text": "(upbeat music) - This week's video is gonna be all about the health benefits of green tea. I've seen some over blown claims. So we're gonna parse through\nand figure out what's what. Also stay tuned to the end of the video to get tips on how to make the healthiest cup of tea possible. Tea is one of those rare beverages that's pretty much universally\naccepted by science as a healthy one. But just remember, as\nwith everything is life you can have too much of a good thing. So don't over do it with the green tea. (upbeat music) The number one thing that\nmakes green tea so good for you is that it's loaded\nwith healthy nutrients. All of these bioactive Polyphenols are awesome for your health. You may have heard of\nsome of them known as Flavonoids, or Catechins. And what those are are antioxidant. What antioxidants do\nis prevent free radical damage to your body. And free radical damage\nto your body over time causes cancer, but let\nme break that down a bit. I know all of you have faucets at home whether its in your\nbathroom or in your kitchen. Some of those faucets have rust on them. The rust is a direct result\nof that free radical damage we always talk about. Now antioxidants prevent\nthat rust from forming so think of antioxidants\nas the rust prevention within our own bodies. - Yes, that's awesome. - Within media it's been mentioned before that those who drink green tea have lower rates of cancer. And its been theorized that\nit has something to do with the huge amount of antioxidants\nfound within green tea. We have to not get too\nexcited by this fact because this is only a\ncorelation and not a causation. Yes, it's good to drink green tea, but no it's not gonna cure and\nprevent all types of cancer. Second great point about green tea. You got stinky breath? Maybe you should try some green tea, but it's none of my business. The nutrients within green\ntea that we just mentioned on this last point known as Catechins, do a great job of inhibiting and killing certain types of bacteria. In fact studies were done and proved that bacteria known to cause bad\nbreath within your mouth was killed by drinking green tea. Also when you have less\nof that specific bacteria you have less plaque. So green tea also decreases the risk of developing a cavity. Point tre about green tea. It does a great job of\ngiving you stable energy without all the jitters. It has about 30-50 milligrams of caffeine. Which is roughly half a cup of coffee. You're still focused,\nyou're still stimulated, but you don't have that jittery feeling that you get with a big cup of coffee. Another nutrient within green tea that works together with caffeine to boost your brain function is called L-Theanine. It's benefit is that it gives\nyour brain the relaxation without the added sedation or drowsiness that come along with\nother relaxing agents. While we've seen in animal and lab models that it increases your good cholesterol and lowers your bad cholesterol. What we've found in animal,\nlab and human trials is that green tea lowers\nyour blood pressure. And if you've watched\nmy hypertension video you know how important it is to keep your blood pressure under control. Point number five. Green tea can help you burn fat. Well, maybe. This is more of an individual\ncase by case basis thing, because not all studies agree on this. But there is a promise\nof increased metabolism, and fat oxidation,\nessentially fat burning. Some of the lab models\nhave shown a decrease in new blood vessel formation\nwithin your fat storage. Meaning that it literally\ntakes away the vital nutrition for your fat, and makes it die. Kicking that fats butt. (metal clinking) Point number six. Animal and lab models\nboth show that Catechins, the nutrient we keep\nmentioning over and over again, decreased the risk of you developing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Science isn't clear on why this occurs but it's theorized that it\nhas something to do with the decrease in the development\nof plaque within the brain. If that doesn't encourage\nyou to take a sip I don't know what will. Point seven. Now this is the game changer, this is the one that\neveryone gets excited about. Green tea may increase your lifespan. There's been a ton of\nresearch done on this. Some studies even have 40,000 participants that show those who drink\n3-5 cups of tea a day have an increase life span, have a decrease all cause mortality, that means dying from anything. Have decreases in heart disease, decreases in strokes, but,\nbefore we get too excited we need to remember\ncorelation verses causation. Just because those who\ndrink green tea live longer, it doesn't mean green\ntea is the sole thing that's responsible for that effect. So yes, enjoy your green tea, but don't think your gonna live forever. Here's how you create the healthiest cup of tea possible. Don't add green tea\ndirectly to boiling water as it destroys those healthy Catechins we've been talking about. Don't go decaf, because\nthe decaffeination process hurts more of the nutrients\nfound within green tea. Add lemon into your tea as\nit aids in the absorption of some of these nutrients. Finally, don't cheap out. Go for the good premium stuff, as it contains more of\nthe healthy nutrients we've been talking about all along. I need you to know this. Don't buy into the BS supplements, that take green tea extract and claim that it has\nmiracle health benefits. They do not. The real thing is always healthier\nthan the supplement form. As always, thanks for watching. Audio check one, two. On the MC Mike, with the\nemerald green scrubs. Catechins, and what basically (shoes squeak) Which is just an EKG but for the brain. Do people know what an EKG is? Catechins, that nutrient\nwe've mentioned many times. (clicking tongue) animal models, and lab models do you even tea bro? Can I interest you in a cuppa\ntea from a squirrel cup? (shark music) what each and every one\nof the politicians needs, is a nice cup, of honest tea. All right, I got a better,\nI got a better one. What do you call a dentist\nwho doesn't like tea? Dentist? Was that good? Kids don't try this at home. Do you get it? (upbeat music)",

        "text": "as science continues to advance in the world of healthcare people are starting to live longer at a higher quality of life although this is an amazing feat for science and society we're going to take a step back from the world of technology and pharmaceuticals to take a deeper dive into what changes the average person can implement today to live a longer and healthier life all links used for research in this video are available in the description below be sure to check them out now let's jump into our five tips to live a long and healthy life first we're going to take a look at hydration an estimated 75 of americans suffer from chronic dehydration so i think it might be time for you to re-evaluate your personal levels of water consumption according to a research paper from harvard university experts recommend that everyone should be drinking between 11 and 16 cups of water a day drinking enough water each day is vital for an abundance of reasons it helps keep your joints lubricated delivers essential nutrients to cells all over your body keeps organs operating efficiently prevents infections and helps regulate body temperature that's why a cold glass of water on a hot day feels like heaven you could also see additional benefits such as improved sleep quality cognition and mood next we're going to take a look at nutrition and supplements well we all know to eat our greens and that mcdonald's isn't the best food for us but there's so much more to optimal nutrition than just eating right the vast majority of us assume that the same healthy food choices are applicable for everybody and for the most part it is true but everyone should take a customized approach a simple blood test can tell you about your current baselines for nutrients within your body and where changes can be made the average american diet finds a number of essential nutrients to be lacking these areas include calcium potassium magnesium and vitamins a c and d let's take vitamin d as an example it is arguably one of the most important nutrients necessary for health according to a 2011 study one billion people worldwide and 41.6 of americans are vitamin d deficient if you are lacking the vitamin you could very well be lacking the benefits as well vitamin d helps your body fight disease resulting in a reduced risk of multiple sclerosis heart disease and the likelihood of developing the flu it has also been found to have an impact on mood regulation and potentially improving the symptoms of depression this is just an example from one nutrient in the body there are so many more that can affect the way your body operates you can add these nutrients into your diet by eating the right foods with a high concentration of the nutrient or look to take supplements that you can find in the drugstore before deciding if you want to take any supplements or making drastic changes please consult a doctor as i am not one just like the previous two points on this list a large percentage of adults also lack sleep according to the cdc one in three adults don't sleep enough the recommendation is that everyone should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep a night having a consistent lack of sleep could lead to potentially the most drastic changes in health versus any other tip in this video a lack of sleep contributes to a wide array of health complications and includes obesity diabetes high blood pressure heart disease and mental distress we've all had a bad night of sleep before and i'm sure you remember how miserable and difficult it was to operate throughout the day versus one where you get a good night's sleep the culminating effect of these long nights and lost hours is referred to as sleep death a term that neuroscientist matthew walker often refers to when sleep debt is incurred it is extremely difficult to make back for every hour of sleep lost it can take up to 4 days to fully recover from its effects when you have night after night of bad sleep your sleep debt works up a tap where it continues to accumulate and gets away from you dr walker believes that this conundrum can shave years off of your life the best way to prepare for a good night's sleep is to put away screens two hours before bed and develop a routine that helps you relax unwinding and disconnecting from your daily activities is important for getting high quality sleep feel free to experiment and find out what works best for you before bed tip number four is to get exercise and stay active we broke this segment down into two sections and first we're going to talk about cardiovascular exercise a lot of people have a misconception that cardio is limited to activities similar to running and cycling when in fact almost any kind of movement can be classified as cardio that means activities such as walking playing sports dancing and even jumping up and down on a trampoline count what these activities all have in common is that they trigger your body to take in more oxygen to maintain energy levels which in turn increases your heart rate among several other reactions within the body getting your heart rate up is essential for strengthening your heart and overall health according to the cdc one in four deaths is caused by heart disease which is why maintaining the health of your heart should be a priority for everybody on top of that it can improve your memory protect your brain against the decline that comes with aging and it also triggers the release of endorphins within your body endorphins are a natural hormone produced within your nervous system they are often referred to as the happy hormone because it is known to make people happier it naturally lifts your mood and is the hormone behind the phenomena of the runner's heart the next segment we're going to look at in exercise is resistance training when it comes to resistance training it turns out that there's more than meets the eye that is not just for building strength and looking fit or muscular a study done by wayne l wescott states that it may help prevent and manage certain diseases such as type 2 diabetes by reducing visceral fat and improving insulin sensitivity it also offers many of the same benefits that cardio offers as well his research also proposes that it can increase bone density and help reduce pain associated with back problems arthritis and fibromyalgia on top of all that it can also reverse other skeletal muscular problems associated with aging the us department of health and human services state that you should do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week to stay healthy the last tip on our list is the importance of personal relationships a review of 148 studies regarding social interactions found that people with strong and developed social circles are 50 percent less likely to die prematurely and interestingly enough it has been found that those who have committed to a life partner on average live three years longer than those who don't when you have people in your life that you can discuss problems with you don't have to internalize the stress the science states that even just thinking about the people that you care about after going through a stressful event or task can lead to quicker recovery from the symptoms of stress as well in turn this keeps stress levels lower over time and reduces its long-term impact on your health on the flip side loneliness is often a significant predictor of poor health for a long time it has been commonly associated with depression and is now even being reported to have an impact on pain tolerance and immune system dysregulation what a lot of people overlook is the preparation and changes influenced by being social being around people can promote several changes to your health such as personal hygiene unintentional peer pressure is another influence when it comes to other health habits such as exercise dietary choices and certain activities that can have both a positive or a negative impact on your health there are so many different factors that come into play when it comes to determining what a healthy life looks like for you the items on this list and the research that the scientists did on these topics are just a few of the most popular health choices of today well that is all for this video don't

        "text": "We normally go after some sort of coveted fast food and recreate it and make it better, right? But wait a minute. What about movie theaters in their popcorn? Are we not gonna check that? 🎵 Okay, so today we're making movie theater popcorn three different ways, but better. This is all came about because, well, I'm a mental movie theater in forever. One of my favorite places to go is the movie theaters. I love going. I've been craving movie theater popcorn forever and I just started thinking, well, why don't I just make it myself? And then I started realizing if I made it myself, it would be so much better. And, well, here we are. And we're gonna be making it the traditional way. Ultra fancy, dancey little pants man. Wait, then last but not least, a sweet dessert decadent way. Let's make this, shall we? So we're at the movie theater. This is my first time walking into a movie theater in a year. And I'm not even going into a watch movie. I'm just cleaning the big up of stupid popcorn. The movie theater. And now my whole car gets to smell like fake butter. So we've got the corn. Ponce Malgate, it smells like artificial butter, vegetable oil, and burnt oil, and popcorn, which smells good. This already has to be one of the blandest foods in the game theory. So there's not that much to say about it. If you've ever been to a movie theater, you know exactly what this tastes like. It tastes okay, it's salty and it's buttery, but it doesn't actually taste like butter. I think we're gonna make it better three different ways. You know how they say beating a dead horse? Well, this thing is already dead. And we're just like, F MSG garlic bread flavor, any salted maple caramel corn. Now obviously the real competitor here is just the simple butter one, but we have to take it over the top for you. Now before we get into all that, let's quickly talk about butter. No unclarified butter is allowed when just coating popcorn. Unless you're making the caramel for the caramel corn. The water in the solids and it will cause your popcorn to go softer than, let me just stop myself there. So what we need to do is clarify our butter. To do that, it's very easy. Get two cups or 500 grams of unsalted butter or more if you want leftovers. Pop that bad boy in a medium sauce pot and set that over medium heat and let that melt completely, then lower the heat to medium low and very gently simmer that for 10 minutes. First there will be some foam that begins to rise to the top, then it almost completely subsides. And once those milk salts in the bottom, just barely begin to turn a light golden. Then that bad boy through a mesh trainer lined with a coffee filter or even a paper towel. That's literally it. See all that liquid gold down there? It almost looks like some sort of angelic liquid. That's because it is. It's papa's clarified butter. Also called ghee. Next up, salt. So to get the salt to really adhere, just get yourself some nice kosher salt, put it in a blender and blend on high speed until it becomes essentially a powder. That's it. That one step gets you popcorn salt that will guarantee the stick to your popcorn. Now let's poop. I mean, pop our corn. Not using any of that bad stuff, so don't even mention it. This pot method will be used for all three flavors, so I'm only going to show you this once. At three tablespoons of your clarified butter or vegetable oil to a pot that's at least six quarts, heat that over medium heat until melted or hot, then add in half a cup of popcorn kernels, top of the lid, and continuously, invigorously shake that pot, keeping the lid held down, and first nothing's going to happen. You're like, oh what's going on? It's just stupid little blah blah. And then suddenly, they'll be popping like mad. And just keep on shaking until the popping begins to subside, and that's your poop corn. Look at that. It's like some sort of magic portal denarnia, except instead of denarnia, it's just a lot of popcorn. Anyway, let's talk about the buttered version. This is our real competitor. We have to defeat the movie theater popcorn with this. Same method. Add your clarified butter, but before adding the kernels though, you're going to want to add a quarter teaspoon of turmeric powder, let's just for color. And a generous sprinkle of your fine ground popcorn salt. Adding your kernels, begin shaking and let the popcorn denarnia portal do its thing, and then bang, you have popcorn. Now from there, toss it in a big bowl and add as much hot melted clarified butter and popcorn salt until your heart sings sweet nothing's to you. I mean, that's it. It really comes down to the ratio of butter and salt. So really pay attention there. It's not magic. Just be sure to season it generously. All right, that's the biggest problem I usually see here. Now since this is the true pinnacle where after, let's get us our taste test. Well, is this astronomically different? Like, whoa, I've never tasted these flavors before. No, it's not. But it is maximized, or at least I believe it is. Let me try this one. I have no sympathy for this one. It's all mass manufactured and everything is made to taste as good as possible. And yet, it's under season, under buttered, it's dry. Like you want your popcorn to be just like, wow. And this has that. This makes you want to go back for another bite. Off of this, we've already won. But we have to have a taste test for this. Joe Joe is back. I'll just load your hand and you tell me when to stop for it. There you go. And this is number one. See, I knew his mouth wasn't big enough for that. Number two. Number one, definitely the winner. And definitely at first, I was like, okay, that's popcorn. But then I had to bite of that when I was instantly like, oh, yeah, it's still almost. Yeah, where this is actually nice little crunch and dissolves in your mouth. We've already smacked down here. I'm going to smack them down two more times. Okay, we already knocked that one out of the park. So let's add a little bit of spice. Next up, we have our MSG garlic bread popcorn. First, start with a loaf of brioche, cut off two to three thick slices and cut those in cubes, place on a rim baking sheet and bake it in an oven, set the 350 Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes until very brown and completely dry. It should crumble into dust when pressed in between your fingers. Then let that cool completely and blend in a blender on high speed until you reach a powdery consistency. Now in a medium sized bowl, add three quarters of a cup or 170 grams of softened clarified butter. And to that, you're going to add half a cup or 30 grams of finely grated Parmigiano 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of MSG, 3 cloves of grated garlic. A quarter cup or 7 grams of finely chopped Italian parsley makes that together, then add as much or as little of your bread crumb mixture as you like. I ended up using about 3 quarters of mine. Then optionally, season with a touch more Parmigiano if desired and keep this stuff stored in the fridge in a container till needed or use it right away. Now all you got to do is pop your corn as directed prior, pop it into a bowl, then gently melt at least a third cup of your garlic bread butter in a small saucepan. Now once that's melted gently, but totally liquid. Pour it over your hot popcorn, season it with your popcorn salt to taste, then toss vigorously and place it into a bowl to finally top it with some additional fresh grated Parmigiano Regiano. I'm not sure how many garlic bread flavored pop crumbs are out there, but whether this is the first or not, this has to be one of the, if not the best version. Okay, last but not least, is the ultra easy salted maple caramel corn. Now obviously make sure your corn is popped, it'll be a full recipe of that before making the caramel. Once done, get a medium saucepan and add a quarter cup or 85 grams of corn syrup, a quarter cup or 80 grams of maple syrup, half a cup or 115 grams of salted, that's right, salted, butter. One cup or 210 grams of packed light brown sugar, give that a very quick and light stirred hydrate, then set it for medium high heat, let that make sure combine and come to a boil, and let that boil for five minutes. You may need to lower the heat to medium if it's boiling too violently. Then remove from the heat and immediately whisk in one teaspoon or five grams of vanilla extract, and half a teaspoon or three grams of baking soda, whas that nicely until you get a consistency that's nice and, then pour all that caramel onto your popped popcorn and fold together until every cloud of corn is covered in our voluptuous most beautiful caramel sauce. You know try not to break up the popcorn into a million pieces though, because if you break the corn, I'm not sure that a pop up can forgive you so you know consider that maybe huh? Anyway place your coated corn evenly divided amongst two baking sheets lined with parchment or soap pat mats and bake it to 250 Fahrenheit for 30 to 45 minutes and you can test its doneness by removing a kernel and letting it cool to see if it hardens. Then pull those brothers out and let them cool completely to room temp, break them up, and serve immediately or store in sealed plastic bags for up to five days. Now we have our two extras for a total of three popcorn options versus well an already beaten recipe but you know why not take it a step further. Let's first begin with the savory, because this is a little bit more upgraded, you've got the cheese and a little bit of crumb. I'm going to take some text that I've picked from this book. This isn't a snack, this is a whole meal. This is nourishing my brain, my heart, and my body. First off the MSG obviously the oom, oom, oom. You've got that rich Parmesan arasiano. It has ryan teneted to be, it is garlic bread popcorn without that brioche, you don't get that almost toasty bread flavor that's in the background and that just completes the whole bite. It's on word two, Mr. Sweetie Pie. That wasn't my best. This is good caramel corn, I can tell you just by making sound with it. Baby, see that is everything that a proper caramel corn should be. If you've never made caramel corn or had homemade caramel corn, it is unlike any tinned old three month caramel corn that you've had. It's an immediate crunch pop, it's light, and then immediately melts. That smooth buttery rich caramel and it's a little salty in the best of ways. If you want to take it beyond the original butter popcorn, this is the only route we should be going. Thank you. You want to know what else has fat clouds of corn covered in papa's hot golden liquid be roll. Alright guys and that is it. So we had our popcorn three different ways and look each and every one came out perfectly and they were good in their own way. I honestly didn't really have a favorite, I thought all three shine through exactly how they were supposed to. The original version was definitive leaf pepper than the movie theater popcorn. Granted the coloring is completely unnecessary, you don't need to add the turmeric, the flavor is plenty there, I just added it for color so that it looks a little bit like the weird neon yellow that they do. The key here is clarifying and using actual real butter, that is the key. And maybe a little MSG if you want to. In your mouth, you know. The garlic bread version was exactly what I imagined, it had umami, it had richness, it had that cheesiness, it garlic-y. It's one of those popcorns where you have one bowl and you don't need anything for the rest of the night. And then of course the salt and caramel, make sure that you understand that when you make that you are going to eat all of it probably by the end of the night and that's just how it goes and that's fine. Okay. Now with all that said, if you enjoyed this video or you learned something, leave a like, subscribe and I will see you next time.",

        "description": " Is there something you could say about the diet side of that?",
        "text": " Is there something you could say about the diet side of that? I'll for you personally, but in general, in order to achieve calorie restriction, like for me eating, I don't mean that sound healthy, but eating carnivore, eating mostly meat has made me feel really good, both mentally and physically. Is there something you could say about the kinds of diets that may improve longevity, but also enable calorie restriction? Well, sure. I mean, the first thing that's important to know is that while many people are interested slash obsessed with what they eat, the data that's come out of animal studies at least is it's far more important when you eat than what you eat. And this was a fantastic study a few years ago by my friend Rafael Dacabo at the National Institutes of Health and Bethesda. He had 10,000 mice on different diets, hoping to find the perfect mix of carbs protein, and fat, and it turns out that the only ones that lived longer were the ones that only ate once a day. And so that, if we're not mice, but I think that we're close enough to mice, that this tells us a lot. But okay, but I still think the best bang for the longevity buck is to do both well. Eat less often, and eat the right things. Now, I'll preface this to say, I'm not a nut about this. I will eat very occasionally a dessert, usually I steal from others, which doesn't count, right? But you got to live life, right? What's the long life if it's not enjoyable anyway? But I also found, and this is, I'll get to your question a second, but my microbiome right now and stomach is at a point where if I try to overeat on a steak, which I did a couple of days ago, I actually had a chicken, a fried chicken specifically. For two days, I felt terrible. I couldn't sleep, it wouldn't go down. So I'm now at a point where even if I want to binge on meat and fried foods, I just can't, it just feels bad. But what do I recommend? Well, what the data says, which I try to follow is that plant-based foods will be better than meat-based foods. And I know that there are a lot of people who disagree. But one of the facts is, there's a few facts. One is that people who live a long time tend to eat those types of diets, Mediterranean, Okinawa diet, they're eating mostly plants with a little bit of meat and not a lot of red meat. And the other fact is that in animals, we know that there's a mechanism that's called M-tor, a little M-capital T-or that responds to certain amino acids that are found in more abundance in meat. And when it responds, it actually shortens lifespan. And the converse, if you starve it of those three amino acids in mostly in meat, then it extends lifespan. And there's a drug called RAPOMISON, which some people are experimenting with. That does that. So you might be able to, I'm just saying this here from all my colleagues, we don't know the results here, but you could potentially take a RAPOMISON light drug and counteract the effects of meat on the long run. I don't know, we should try that actually. We could do that in a lab. But getting to the bottom of this, what I think is going on in the lab, is that the one is that just like testosterone and growth hormone, you will get temporary, maybe not temporary, immediate health benefits. You'll feel great, you'll get more muscle energy. But the problem is, I think it's at the expense of long-term health and longevity. Well, this is actually something I worry about in terms of long-term effects or the cost in terms of longevity. It's very difficult to know how your choices affect your longevity, because the impact is down the line. Just because something makes me feel good now, like eating only meat makes me feel good now, I wonder what are the cost down the line. Well, think about what I was saying about the trade-offs between growth and reproduction, which is what a mouse does, and a whale that grows slowly, reproduces slowly, lives a long time. It's called the disposable somatheory, cook would just propose that in the 70s. What meat probably does is put you in the mouse category, super fertile, growth fast, heel fast, and then if you want to be a whale, you should restrict meat and do things that promote the preservation of your body. Is it difficult to eat a plant-based diet that you perform well under, so mentally and physically? Almost, I'm asking almost like anecdotal question, unless you know the science. Well, the science is still being worked out, but from the synthesis of everything I've read, I try to eat a diet that's definitely full of leafy greens, particularly spinach is great, because it's got the iron that we need plenty of vitamins. I also try to avoid too much fruit and berries, particularly fruit juice, definitely avoid that sugar high, spiking your sugar is not healthy in the long run. The other thing that's interesting is we discovered what we call zenohormetic molecules. Let me unpack that, because it's a terrible name and I take full responsibility with my friend Conrad Howitz. The zenoh means cross species, and hormesis is the term that what doesn't kill you makes you live longer and be healthier. We're getting cross species health improvements by molecules that plants make. Plants make these molecules when they're also under adversity or perceived adversity. For instance, I understand if you want really healthy good oranges, you can drive nails into the bark of the tree before you harvest, same with wine, you typically want them to be dry before you harvest or covered in fungus. That's because these plants make these colorful and zenohormetic molecules that make themselves stress resistant turn on their sort to end defenses, the sergeins remember. When we eat them, we get those same benefits. That's the idea. We've evolved to do so. This isn't a coincidence. It's my theory, that we want to know when out food supplies is under adversity because we need to get ready for famine. We hunker down and preserve our body and by eating these colored food, so I practically speaking, if it's full of color, if there's been some chewing by a caterpillar, organic, grown locally in local farms, I'll eat that versus a watery, insipid light-colored lettuce that's been grown in California. What do you want vegetables that have suffered? You want to David Goggins as a vegetable. That's the zenohormetic molecules. I love that. I'm going to take that one with me. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, I follow my Instagram. It's always screaming. You want to eat that. He's basically the zenohormetic version of a human. I like it. The molecules that are representative of the stress that has been that plant has been under. Yeah. The best example of that is resveratrol, which many people, including myself, take as a supplement, grapes, grapefines produce that in abundance when they're dried out or they have too much light or fungus. That we've shown activates the Sertu enzyme in our bodies, which remember is what extends lifespan in yeast and slows down aging in the brain. That's beautiful. Yeah. I tend to avoid fruit as well. So green veggies, anything that's not very sweet. So I would just say you're relatively low. Like you try to avoid sugary things as well. Yeah. I'm fairly militant about that. I rarely would add sugar to anything. Occasionally, I would eat a slice of cheesecake, but that would be maybe once or twice a year. You have to give in occasionally. But yeah, anything that's sweet, I would rather substitute something like Stevia if I need a sugar hit.",

        "text": "What I want to do\nin this video is talk about the difference\nbetween vectors and scalars. And they might sound like\nvery complicated ideas, but we'll see over the\ncourse of the videos that they're actually\nvery simple ideas. So first I'll give you a\nlittle bit of a definition. And then I'll give you\na bunch of examples, and I think the examples\nwill make things super clear. Hopefully, they'll make\nthings super clear. A vector is something\nthat has a magnitude, or you could kind of\nview that as a size, and it has a direction. So \"and\" it has a direction. A scalar only has a\nmagnitude, or size. And if that doesn't\nmake sense to you, it will hopefully\nmake sense to you in a second when I\nshow you an example. For example. Let's say that I have,\nlet's say that that's the ground-- let me do\nthe ground in a more appropriate ground-like color. So this is green\nright over here. And let's say that\nI have a brick here. I have a brick on the ground. And I pick up that\nbrick, and I move it over to this place right over here. So I move the brick\nright over there. And then I take a ruler\nout, and I say, wow, I've moved the brick 5 meters. So my question to you, is\nmy measurement of 5 meters, is it a vector or a scalar? Well, if I just\ntell you 5 meters, you just know the\nsize of the movement. You just know the\nmagnitude of the movement. So if someone were\nto just say 5 meters, this is a scalar quantity. And when we're referring\nto moving something, or how much something has, I\nguess, changed its position, and I don't give\nyou the direction, we're talking about distance. And I'm assuming you've\nheard the word distance. How far of a distance\nhas something traveled? So this is distance. So we could say that this\nblock, or this brick, because of my picking\nit up and moving it, has moved a distance\nof 5 meters. But if I didn't show\nyou this picture here, and someone just\ntold you that it moved a distance\nof 5 meters, you wouldn't know if it moved\nto the right 5 meters, you wouldn't know if it\nmoved to the left 5 meters, if it moved up or\ndown or in or out, or-- You don't know what\ndirection it moved 5 meters. You just know it moved 5 meters. If you want to\nspecify that, so, we could say that this\nbrick right over here, that it moved 5\nmeters to the left. Now we have specified a\nmagnitude, right over there. So that is a magnitude. And we have specified a\ndirection, to the left. So you now explicitly know that\nthey went 5 meters to the-- oh, sorry. It should be 5\nmeters to the right. Let me change that. So, 5 meters to the right\nis what it got moved. It started here and went\n5 meters to the right. So once again, the\nmagnitude is 5 meters, and the direction\nis to the right. So what I've just\ndescribed to you right here is a vector quantity. So this, all of this\nbusiness right over here, this is a vector. And when you talk about\nthe movement, the change in position, and you give its\ndirection, the vector version of distance, I guess you could\ncall it, is displacement. So this right here\nis displacement. So the correct thing\nto say, you would say that this brick\nhas been displaced 5 meters to the\nright, or it has been moved a distance of 5 meters. Distance is a scalar\nquantity-- I didn't tell you what direction we moved it in. Displacement is a\nvector quantity. We told you that\nit is to the right. Now let's explore this if\nwe talk about the actual, well, we'll talk about the\nspeed or velocity of something. So let's say that this\n5 meters was traveled and let's say that\nthe change in time-- let me just, because\nyou're probably not familiar with what that means. So let's say that the\nchange in time right here, when I moved this\nblock 5 meters, let's say that it\nwas, I don't know, let's say that the change\nin time was 2 seconds. So maybe right when the\nblock started moving, maybe on my stopwatch it said 0. And then on my stopwatch\nwhen it stopped moving, it said, or when it\ngot to this position, I should say-- when it\nleft from this position, my stopwatch said 0. When it got to this position\nmy stopwatch said 2 seconds. So the change in time, or the\nduration we're dealing with, is 2 seconds. And this is, for all\nwe know, time only goes in the positive direction. So you could assume\nthat it's, you could pick that as a vector\nor a scalar quantity, I guess, because there's\nonly one direction for time, as far as we know, or\nat least in what we're going to deal with for\nthe simple physics. So what is a measure of\nhow fast this thing moved? So, how fast did\nthis thing move? So we could say it moved\n5 meters in 2 seconds. Let me write this down. So it moved 5 meters\nper 2 seconds. Or we could write this as\n5/2 of a meter per second. Or 5 divided by 2 is what? 5 divided by 2 is 2.5\nmeters per second. This right here is just\nthe 5 divided by 2, let me make that clear. That right there is just\nthe 5 divided by the 2. So my question to you. This 2.5 meters per\nsecond tells you how far it traveled in a\ncertain amount of time. Is this a vector or\na scalar quantity? It is telling you\nhow fast it went, but is it giving you just\na size of how fast it went? Or is it also giving\nyou direction? Well, I don't see\nany direction here. So this is a scalar quantity. And the scalar quantity for\nhow fast something is going is speed. So we could say that\nthe speed of the brick is 2.5 meters per second. Now, if we do the\nsame calculation, and we say it went\n5 meters-- I'll just write m for meters-- to the\nright in 2 seconds, then what do we get? We get 2.5, once again, 2.5\nmeters per second-- I'll just abbreviate them as meters\nper second-- to the right. So is this a vector\nor a scalar quantity? I'm telling you the magnitude\nof the speed, that's right here. This is the magnitude,\n2.5 meters per second. And I'm also telling you\nthe direction, to the right. So this is a vector quantity. This is a vector quantity. And when you specify both\nthe speed and the direction, so the 2.5 meters per second\nis a scalar, and the direction, you are talking about velocity. You are talking about velocity. So an easy way to\nthink about it, if you're thinking\nabout change in position and you specify the direction\nof the change in position, you're talking\nabout displacement. If you're not talking\nabout the direction, you want the scalar version,\nyou're talking about distance. If you're talking about how\nfast something is going, and you give the direction\nthat it's going in, you're talking about velocity. If you don't give the direction\nyou are talking about speed. Hopefully that helps\nyou a little bit. In the next video,\nwe're going start working with these a\nlittle bit to start solving some basic questions\nabout how fast something is going, or how\nfar it might travel, or how long it might\ntake it to get someplace.",

        "text": "[Music] hey guys and welcome to these long awaited New York apartment hunting video I have been tingling to make this video tingling is a weird word it sounds like I have to pee out this video um I am an itching to make this video for a while because I just love apartment hunting I love looking at spaces I love thinking about prices and what's a good deal even in like my free time I will go to open houses and be like that [ __ ] who eats the free food and pisses off real estate agents because I just love looking at real estate so today I'm gonna walk you guys through the entire in New York apartment hunting a process I toured over ten apartments so I'm gonna show you all of them give you my thoughts and I'm also going to include exact rent prices and locations because that's what makes one of these [ __ ] videos useful to begin with I know it's very expensive I know it can feel personally offensive when people pay a lot of money in rent but I want to live here while I'm young I'm very lucky to be able to afford it I know it's thanks to you guys and yeah I just wanted to be transparent about rent because I don't think it should be a big [ __ ] taboo don't roast me thank you so Before we jump into my actual apartment tours I wanted to give you guys some background on the New York real estate market because I have found that it is so different from anywhere else in the United States first of all rental units in New York just go really [ __ ] fast one of the first apartments I toured in New York I showed up on time to the open house and somebody else had already showed up ten minutes early and submitted their application and the apartment was gone by the time the open house opened in New York you have to be ready to decide literally where you're gonna live within like 20 minutes or a couple hours of looking at a place what is a good time to start apartment hunting in New York I would recommend to start looking at apartments online around six weeks to a month before you're ready to move now six weeks out you're probably not going to actually be able to rent any of the apartments that you look at but I always think it's a good idea to do some research online to get a feel for how much space you get for certain prices what different neighborhoods are looking like so when you actually go apartment hunting you're not getting screwed over and you know what's a good deal and what is a rip off street easy is the main site where people list rental in New York you can also look on Zillow but I just found street easy to be better organized and it was a lot easier to contact the agents and arrange times to view apartments so that was the main one that I ended up using then I'd recommend coming out to New York around 2 to 3 weeks before you're ready to move in that's what I did I came out here January 17th I apartment hunted right after I landed in New York and I was ready to sign a lease starting on February 1st not being said if you aren't familiar with New York I would recommend either starting by coming out here and subletting an apartment for a couple months or making a visit in advance and really taking a look at a bunch of different neighborhoods at different times of day visiting New York feels very different than living here and the neighborhoods that you might love when you visit you're like ooh Times Square baby trust me you don't want to live in Times Square if you're not sure it's always better to be on the safer side and sublet a place first before making a year-long commitment to a lease fall and winter are generally considered offseason in New York where there are fewer rental units available so it can be harder to find the exact type of unit that you're looking for but because fewer people move in the winter there's also lower demand meaning that you can get a much better price on an apartment I would say apartments were renting for like 10 to 15% cheaper in the winter than they were in the summer in the summer there are a lot more options available on the market but I've heard that it's also very very competitive because everybody likes moving in the summer the weather is nice people will come up to New York post-grad which means that you have to be ready to sign a lease even faster and you end up paying a premium on rent because there's so much demand so how much money do you need saved up in order to move to New York I would recommend saving four months of rent before you move out to New York which I know is a lot of money but it will go very very fast here first of all when you go tour an apartment and you are ready to put down an application there is a twenty dollar application fee and they will also ask for usually a month's worth of rent upfront as kind of a good-faith deposit while they approve your application in order to hold the apartment if you don't get approve you will get that money back if you do get approved that will go towards your security deposit then if you do get approved for the apartment you'll have to pay first month's rent and a broker's fee which is such a little [ __ ] honestly basically what a broker is is the person who arranges open houses who shows the apartment who has you signed the leases so as a tenant you have to pay them for their services most broker fees are between one month of rent and 15% of annual rent which I personally think is such a ripoff but that's real estate baby I guess in good news though they did just pass a law in New York that the landlord now has to pay the broker's fee I think it should go in effect to the next couple months and that would be great news for tenants because it would mean that you wouldn't have to pay several thousand dollars more just to get an apartment but it is possible that rent will just go up because landlords will then incorporate the broker's fee into the monthly rent price so yeah turns out landlords still have control over everything in the end we love to see it New York is also very strict about the income you need to qualify for an apartment pretty much every landlord will require that your yearly salary is 40 times the monthly rent price most apartments will also accept guarantors within the United States but your guarantor is yearly salary has to be 80 times rent which is a lot my final tip is to make sure you come with your paperwork prepared I will list on the screen now a list of all the documents you need in order to apply for an apartment here it was best if you gather them up front at front because basically once you find an apartment you like you will put down your application fee and your good faith deposit and that will usually buy you around two days to submit all of your application materials so it's just best if you have them all up front you can submit them right away rather than potentially losing out on an apartment because you couldn't find your tax return or you couldn't get a letter from your landlord in time and yeah it's always good to be prepared the Girl Scouting me talking all right so now let's get into the stuff that you guys have probably been waiting for this entire video which is the actual apartment tours so I was looking for a studio or small one-bedroom in downtown Manhattan for under $2,500 since I work from home and I make videos I really prioritize having good natural light a quiet apartment and some nice little vintage details because I am a vintage ho so my first appointment was in East Village the East Village is historically an immigrant neighborhood like us all of New York is technically historically an immigrant neighborhood because we're all immigrants then in the 60s and 70s it became a center of like punk rock counterculture I personally liked it because it has a very like old-school New York feel mixed with a lot of young artsy people Jesus I just described gentrification didn't I so the first apartment that I visited was a studio in East Village but it was a pretty spacious one at that there was definitely enough room for a bed and a desk and a little corner to film in which is pretty much what I needed in an apartment I also really liked that it had high ceilings it made the space feel very spacious it also had a separate kitchen which was kind of nice because a lot of apartments in New York will have the kitchen like as part of the main studio area and it's kind of nice to have that separate space to cook and I keep all of that kitchen clutter the bathroom was also the bathroom it did the job I'd had quite a long hallway which was a little bit awkward but I'm not complaining there was enough space for like some extra shoe storage the windows were pretty big so it did get a good amount of light but they faced north before this round of apartment hunting I really had never thought about the way that my windows faced I didn't care I was like it's a window what's the difference I learned the hard way in my last apartment that north-facing windows never get direct sunlight because of the way the Sun rises it basically made filming videos so hard because I would have to use studio lights pretty much all the time in order to get enough light to film with video and especially during the winter where I was at home all the time I just like never fell to the Sun on my face it made me so sad and it made me constantly want to get out of my apartment so this time around I was kind of a stickler for getting apartment windows that faced south which would get direct sunlight for the majority of the day or at least east or west where they would get a couple hours of direct sunlight another thing that I always look for in apartments is just like the vibes some apartments you walk in and you're like ooh this is a weird a weird place like I couldn't imagine myself living here but this one felt super homey although I might have been biased because the furniture was just really nice after I toured the apartment I was also allowed to go up on the rooftop now the vast majority of pre-war buildings in New York will not let you go on the roof because it's like not zoned to hold human beings and the landlords don't want to get sued so it was really special that this one had a rooftop it obviously was not particularly well finished but it was really gorgeous to see the view of New York and it would just be really fun to like be able to have friends up there to get drunk and go up on the roof to even shoot videos up there however I did look around and I noticed that there was an empty lot that they were starting construction on right next to the building which would be a concern in terms of shooting videos a day after I toured this apartment I did ask the landlord for an application just cuz I got like good vibes from the building but he said the apartment had already been rented just cuz it was such a good price but it's okay because ultimately because of the north-facing windows and potential construction nearby it probably wouldn't have been the best fit for me as a video person anyway the next apartment I saw was a 1-bedroom in East Village for $2,300 what I loved about this apartment was the vintage details around the windows and this absolutely gorgeous fireplace I could really envision this as like the perfect backdrop for fashion videos through this doorway there was another huge room but unfortunately it didn't have any natural light this is like such a New York thing but there were windows in the living room that directly faced brick so it was essentially just another wall for this apartment it wasn't as big of a deal because there were other windows that let light in but it didn't mean there was a lot of square footage that I couldn't fully take advantage of because I couldn't fill there because it was so dark but it could have been a good place to like put my bed and have more like a cozy night time 5 the kitchen was quite small but had a nice modern finishes as did the bathroom which actually also had a full-size tub which is very very rare for New York out of all the apartments I saw I think this was my favorite aesthetically however this apartment was [ __ ] loud it faced a multi-lane street and the glass was just really thin it was not soundproof properly it sounded like I was there on the street another concern I had was I could occasionally hear the pipes like squealing and rattling and some apartments if they're not well maintained when somebody showers or turns on their heat the pipes will like squeal and scream at you Ross your man Jake for me if I had to record a video I just like wouldn't be able to do it and it would be really frustrating you know like getting set up for work for the day and then the pipes are just like hahaha that was my best pipe impersonation I wouldn't have been able to do my job if I lived there so yeah that kind of stuff I didn't end up applying to that one my next appointment was in Kelsey which if I had to put it in a nutshell I would say that it is a little bit of a bougie ER kind of like the type of person who owns an art gallery or is featured in Architectural Digest 5 there's a lot of art galleries fancy restaurants and it's also a large center of lgbtq+ culture in New York it's also a great place if you need to commute because it's so close to all these different subway lines I didn't think personally it was the best fit for me in terms of neighborhood but it is still like a really really good location and I really like this apartment this studio with a couple floors up and a walk-up and the actual studio space was quite small it could pretty much fit a bed and then a very small desk if you got the location just right and that's it so for me that was definitely pushing it a little bit especially because I have to work from home however the thing that I wanted to check out in this apartment was the beautiful outdoor space this Terrace face the back of the building and it was actually up on the third floor so I got a decent amount of light but it was also like so nicely tucked in a little Cove of buildings and I don't know I felt like I was like wrapped in buildings it was really lovely the outdoor space was just so freakin beautiful that I was really considering it but ultimately it came down to a value calculation of do I want to spend six months cramped inside a tiny apartment where I can barely fit a desk in a bed and then have six months with this glorious outdoor space or would I rather have an apartment where I have enough space year-round and maybe no outdoor space so I ended up not applying to that apartment but it was a really lovely space my next apartment was back in the East Village it was a 1-bedroom for around $2,000 I forget the exact price on this one but it was a lot of space for the price it was kind of a suspiciously good deal when I had seen this online I really liked the large windows and this little archway detail that it had in the middle however what I didn't see on the listing is that this apartment had like a valley in the middle it's hard to tell in this video but the floors were so slanted inwards it was literally like a dent inside the apartment the broker was trying to convince me she said the last tenants put like books underneath their couch to level out their furniture and like they made it work but I think a problem for me more than the fact that the floorboards were slanted is that that is a sign of a really badly maintained building basically over time hardwood floors will cave in but in order for hardwood floors to cave in that severely the landlord had not updated that apartment in probably like 50 a hundred years like it was really really slanted if a unit is like that badly neglected I think that it could point to larger issues with the building and it turns out that I was right because as I was walking down from that apartment there was this eighty year old lady who came out of another one of the units in the building and she was like did you just go to an open house please do not live here I have bedbugs I have contacted the landlord they won't do anything about it it is disgusting here please do not move in I was like oh my god this is New York baby look out for those red flags if you're getting weird vibes from a building if it seems like it hasn't been well taken care of it probably has not been at this point I was getting a little demoralized so I decided to check out this apartment just for the hell of it I kind of had just gotten obsessed with this apartment on street easy and I knew it was too expensive for me but I really wanted to check it out anyway because I happened to be in New York and in the neighborhood so I was like my god this apartment was on the border of Greenwich and West Village which I would describe as like the East villages bougie or older brother there are some of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York hence this apartment being expensive as [ __ ] to put it in a nutshell when you think of where a girl in a rom-com lives this is the neighborhood it's so like romantic quiet the architecture is universally beautiful so this apartment I mean I don't even know what to say about this apartment because like I knew off the bat that I wasn't going to get it because it was so expensive but um let's just take a moment to add rule over this place okay look at those windows look at that chandelier look vintage details and most importantly look at that [ __ ] terrace this place have like the most gigantic private Terrace it was overlooking a park so it had like sweeping New York City views it was lovely it was so lovely this apartment is so nice I showed so many people the videos of this apartment cuz I was just like look at it look at how nice it is I still would daydream about that apartment sometimes anyways on to the next apartment that I saw my next apartment was in Chinatown now I kind of had mixed feelings about living in Chinatown because on one hand I felt like such a gentrified like going in there and looking at a nice loft apartment when there are like grandmas and grandpas who have lived there their entire lives but I also felt this need to like show my appreciation for Chinatown I think there definitely still is a stigma in New York for living in Chinatown and even this listing was listed as Little Italy online instead of Chinatown as like a way to get more people to come to the listing which is kind of shitty so I don't know it's complicated but that's where this apartment was so anyways this apartment it was a little bit over budget for me it was $2,600 but my like heart dropped when I walked into this place it was so so gorgeous this was the first apartment I'd seen that had south-facing windows and oh my god it was so so nice seeing and feeling that direct Sun come through the window I also just really vibed with the layout of this apartment it just like made sense to me I could definitely envision the bedroom being super nice and cozy and just curling up there and then having a workspace out in the main living room and shooting outfit videos against this brick wall they were also in the process of refinishing the apartment so all of the finishes on the kitchen in the bathroom were super super nice yeah this was just it was like the perfect space for me I was so so so so close to applying to this place but as I was getting my phone to send the broker the apartment fee the upstairs neighbor started walking around and I could hear like every single step the ceilings were just insanely thin and then the upstairs neighbor also turned on the TV and even though it was that like a medium volume I could hear everything going on the TV I was like maybe I could make this work like if my upstairs neighbor works a nine-to-five I can just film during the day while they're gone but then it's like what if they work from home what if there's a holiday and they come home what if they are just like loud is fine and I can't film anything in this apartment so once again the fact that I have to film videos to my apartment kind of [ __ ] this one over for me so moving onwards we have apartment number [ __ ] like 500 I've looked at so many of these this was quite the mystery unit a couple days into my apartment honey came up on street easy and it didn't have any photos which you normally it's like a horrible sign but I happen to have some extra time so I decided to check out this apartment this one was two thousand two hundred and ninety five dollars it was a studio in East Village and it actually turned out to be a really good option the reason they didn't have photos was because they were renovating it versus the apartment just being ugly as [ __ ] so it turned out to be pretty promising they were in the process of renovating the kitchen and giving it new finishes and they had also recently like torn down the wall that had separated the kitchen before so the apartment seemed a lot more open and spacious which was definitely a good move this apartment was also so tall that it had a little storage loft which was super cute unfortunately you couldn't sleep up there but it would still be a good place for storage and I thought it was still cool detail I also asked the broker to show me all of the finishes of the kitchen and he kind of like showed me in the pile of boxes I was sitting in the apartment the countertops and what the sink would look like and it looked like they were renovating it to be really modern so it would look really nice the only con of this apartment is that it wasn't the brightest the windows face Northwest so it would get some direct sunlight only in the afternoon but I definitely kept this one in mind as something to apply to as I went to the rest of my apartments for the day next up I headed back to Greenwich Village to look at a one-bedroom for $2,700 now this was a little bit out of my price range but I thought it was worth checking out because if it was a larger space I was like maybe willing to push my budget a little bit and I just liked looking at apartments I was like wow [ __ ] not right when I walked into this apartment the thing that struck me the most was how peaceful and quiet it was it was five flights of stairs up and face the back of the building so he really couldn't even hear Street noise it felt like a nearly peaceful Oasis away from New York I also loved the finishes on this apartment it had brick walls but they were painted white a while ago I had DIY my own wine hole out of a piece of styrofoam that's how much I love white brick walls it also had dark wood floors which hoo baby ooh baby that gives me going in a different way a lot of apartments in New York has the classic kind of orangey hardwood floor which is still very nice but it feels a little bit bright and brassy compared to my preferred aesthetic which is a little bit more like muted which oh these floors were so good overall this was such a beautiful apartment but my main concern was the kind of long and narrow layout it would make it harder to film outfit videos because in order to film a full body shot I need my camera a certain distance away from me and this apartment just didn't have a lot of width it was just a long void but it wasn't girthy yeah I was a little bit on the fence about this one I wasn't like so crazy head over heels for it that I needed to get it and then I needed to spend two thousand seven hundred dollars a month on it so I wanted to take like a couple more days to think about it but it turns out this apartment was super popular it so it got taken off the market by the end of the open house so I never got a chance to apply to it anyway so at this point it was coming to the end of the weekend and I was a little bit nervous because I had seen so many apartments and the ones that I liked even a little bit were already off the market so I basically at that point was considering that two thousand two hundred and ninety five dollar one in East Village that was still getting renovated maybe the one in Chinatown but I had one more apartment to see this one was a studio with a little bedroom alcove for two thousand dollars per month I showed up so early to this open house because at this point I have seen like what 13 apartments I have seen so many hard minutes all the ones I liked were going off the market so fast and I was reaching like the end of my rope I was ready to just commit to an apartment knew what I was looking for I knew what my options were and I was like I think this could be the one so I showed up like 15 minutes early to the open house and I made sure I was the first one in the door because this was such a good price it was the cheapest apartment I had seen in Manhattan not saying that 2,000 a month is cheap but for Manhattan it is very hard to come by right when I walked in I was like they seize it baby this is what I've been looking for her so sorry I'm like horrible at building suspense I'm just way too excited about this apartment it has windows that face south it has open views and right when I walked in there were so much direct sunlight streaming through the windows I was just like oh give me that dopamine baby give me that vitamin D I need it because it's winter and I'm so sad it has a little bit of that vintage charm it has an exposed brick wall but it has a pretty updated kitchen and it has a real oven which is also something that sometimes is a little bit rare in New York especially for cheaper cheaper apartments like this one in the back it has a cozy of a whole bedroom nook which I actually really like it's nice to have a little bit of separation between my sleeping space and my main working area there are definitely some cons of this apartment though namely that the ceilings are very very short like noticeably short while you walk in here and you're like bro I could I could literally touch the ceiling I think that they are like like eight feet tall ceilings and the other quirk of this apartment is that the bathroom is one of those funky ones where the toilet is in a separate room than the shower and this absurdly tiny sink so yeah the things you do to get slightly cheaper rent so in case it wasn't incredibly obvious this is the apartment that I ended up Tuesday it's all mine oh yeah so yeah I have lived here for about a month now and I love it like i 100% chose the right apartment for me kiss good job Ashley it's just a great place and I'm so excited that I can finally show you guys because I've been like hiding it in all of my Instagram stories and stuff anyways I hope this was really helpful for you guys if you are apartment hunting best of luck may the odds ever be in your favor and I will see you guys next week bye [Music]",

        "description": "What do you feel when you see this album cover?",
        "text": "What do you feel when you see this album cover? What about this one? What about this one? Of what I can tell there is a goats giving birth to a man wearing a chain and the doctors also would go. Can you tell the difference between these three covers? That's right. The goat one is the good one. The artwork for album covers are crucial to me. While it's important for music to have its own feeling and you should get most of it from that, I love how artists can immerse you in the world of an album before you even start listening to it. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like covers for books and movies and video games are important for marketing, but once you get into them, the content stands on its own. Like the box art of a game doesn't necessarily affect the gameplay experience. But for albums, the music on an album can make a cover better and the cover of an album can make the music feel better. It's a partnership that goes hand-in-hand to create the perfect audio visual journey. I sound like a friggin' flat-screen TV sale. But I'm 100% right. But really, album artwork can enhance your listening experience. A lot of times, that album art can make me feel like I don't even want to listen to the music. Even if the music is good. While there's some covers where you gotta just drop everything and listen to it. Like, look at this. Music is also the only visual marketing medium for art. Testil has the gust to go crazy with it. While both movies and video games have gone from beautiful, hand-drawn, expressive covers and posters to just boring, shadowy guy holding gun. Or a bunch of origin, oooh actors. Oh, very excited. Artists in the music world still kind of have the freedom to express their music in an interesting visual way. Rianna can be one of the biggest pop stars in the world and her album cover can be her as a friggin' blurry little girl with a crown over her eyes. Cover it in braille poetry. Like I said in the album sequencing video, I love the idea of just thinking about the things that go on outside of the actual music making process. Like, once you finish an album after you put years of your life into a body of work that could be over an hour long, how can you decide on one picture that encapsulates the feeling of that entire thing? That's like if you got this tattoo. That's your tattoo. That's you. That's you now forever. It becomes a part of who you are. If it's a good cover, it's forever associated with you and your music. One of my favorite things to do pre-pandemic was as soon as I finished making a video out relax. Kind of take the edge off, you know? Kind of freaking get away from the comment section and drive down to the record store. Flip through the records of the soul section and just pick depending on which covers look the nicest. I was just picking one and I listened to that album. I liked the idea of somebody 70 years ago making a song, not thinking about the fact that in 70 years time some random kid is going to pick it up in a record store and listen to it for the first time just based on how it looks after they finished doing a video for a YouTube channel. No, they probably didn't know that. But why did I pick the covers I did? What actually makes an album cover good? The best album covers feel like a doorway into that world and once you listen to that it will make you want to go back into that world. There's album cover that are so iconic, they have transcended the music or even the genre itself. You've probably seen some of these covers even if you've never listened to the music and then there's covers you wish you'd never see. Sometimes you can just look at an album's artwork and you can tell how the music is going to feel. When you look at the watch the throne cover, you know you're about to listen to something extravagant. No matter how this album actually sounded, it would feel like eating pizza with a gold working knife. How do you eat it? If you have hands, this man is on the cover crying in the shower where you don't know if the water is from the tears of your eyes or the frigging shower head. This is actually clever foreshadowing to when you end up doing the exact same thing. Day in, when you look at this cover you know this man's about to be struggling and this whole album look at his eyes. There's beats that literally sound like how he looks then over and just stumbling. Contanic rising. I listened to this album because of the cover. I was like dude this better made me feel like I'm in bikini bottom and it did not. This one. Now if we look at this album by Nyle Horan. Horan? Horan? Horan? I don't know how I'm supposed to feel. It doesn't even look like he knows what to feel. Why is he just standing on his chair like this? Just sit down. How's there so much happening and there's nothing happening within. Everything is going on and nothing is going on at the same time. This cover might be a masterpiece. A lot of the feelings you get from these covers have to do with color. For me colors be most important part of the whole process deciding on what color your music sounds like. Every song has a color. Every song has a feeling that is associated with a color and that can be shown on the cover. I've ever seen anybody point this out but in 2015 a lot of the sound of that time was like dark and moody. Airy spacious. Kind of devoid of color. Like it was one long winter in terms of the subject matter and the production for that year. And almost every major album cover reflected that especially in hip hop a lot of the covers were primarily in whites and blacks and grays. I love the darker feeling of this year. It felt like the last year before we just shifted suddenly in 2016 to like a brighter more colorful year. Suddenly in 2016 there were a lot more artists focused on fun music with more upbeat vibes and a lot of the covers reflected that. I used to make color playlists based on how the songs would make me feel and how the artwork would match that. Like every time I think of this cover for depression cherry it just feels warm and passionate you know. And every time I look at this maroon 5 one it just pisses me off. What is the fawnce? The colors? What is going on? Did you all really put snapchat filters on your album cover? Different shades of different colors actually have different feelings too. Whether it's like a darker blue more melancholy versus a brighter blue. I listened to this Casey Musgraze album because it just it looked like a nice summer day. I was like do I'm ever getting into that. And it was called Golden Hour. What's she got me? What more could I mean less than a country like that. And she got me off the album cover. Different green spill different ways. Like this one just feels more lush you know like a little bit brighter. This darker green makes you feel like you're walking through it. For instance, swap when you're listening to a James Blake has this murky greenish brownish gray cover with these dark clouds distorted trees. And the first song is just in repeating. I can't believe you don't want to see me over and over. You're like oh this one is a sad song. Tyler creators' e-world with a soft pink behind dark jagged and rough edges of Tyler cut out and pasted on the frickin thing. It gives a great idea about the album sounds. Bringing two of the Tyler's best sounds together. Depending on how it's done I love when covers don't 100% fit how the music feels either. You look at this album cover from Parabor and it's a frickin it looks like a nice day on the beach. The first song starts. It's all happy with Sebastian from a little mermaid in this field drum and the Haley Williams starts singing. All right this is a sad song. On the other hand sometimes an artist like the Beatles will just give you a cover and be like you feel it it. You listen and you figure it out for yourself. And I respect that. Gambino did the exact same thing this year with this album and he was also like figure out the title, figure out the song titles. Just figure out the album. Speaking of Gambino, color is essential especially when it's just a close-up shot of your face. This cover for because the internet just has such perfect colors. I don't know what it is about it. Good color allows you to just have that shot of your face and make it still within the vibe. For me if you're going to put yourself on a cover I like when it's in an interesting or creative way. Like don't just put the same facial expression for three covers in a row. Why is she doing the Debbie Ryan face? And she said oh that's what we're doing? Best. If you're going to put yourself on there at least do something to stand out like interesting color or striking makeup or cool pose just to shake it up or literally just shake it up or literally shake it up or shake up shake it up or Hill has her face on the miseducation of lore Hill but her face is literally etched onto a school desk. When you look at Janelle Monet's dirty computer is there a more extravagant way to put your face on an album cover? Not only is she card in diamonds but there's like a sun behind her. The colors are cool and hot at the same time. She's literally describes Janelle Monet to a tease. She's got album worse like just multiple hers. Like if she's going to be on a cover she's going to be on a cover you know. Speaking of being on an album cover here we have Birdman's and a morphing into an urge. If you're going to pose on your album cover it's nice if you're wearing something interesting you know or posing in an interesting way. Tori Lane's this man has always had the most annoying album covers to me. He's standing here with his face like this and in the background as he says I told you what did you tell me bro? I don't I would listen to the album and find out but there's a skit and much we never single saw and then on this cover this is just him with his huge bald head it's like he wanted you to know it was bald. He didn't just stand normally either he was like check it out. You can even have the pose fit how the music feels like J. Cole on four-seals drive this man this man this just this just looks in the style. You can recognize it on the friggin roof of a house dude. I already know we're taking a trip down for you memory lane. The only brothers with that beautiful font and a great color that you can almost hear before you even play it. Like you could just tell it's going to be smooth. R&B does a lot of poses. R&B does a lot of sitting laying down standing for me the more dramatic you look the better. When you look at ushers 8 7 0 1 you know this is about to be an R&B album not R&B. This is R&B album and then he did this one. Sure why. On the other hand we have a lot of album covers and music that are just straight up. These are the kind of albums you can hang up on your freaking wall and not even know there was like music for these things. I think it go up in a museum. The Cole distant and jagged mountains of radio heads kid A the timelessness of the black and white cover on to pimple butterfly letting us know that the issues kendrick talks about aren't going away anytime soon. The black men celebrating in front of the white house while the judge lies lifeless on the ground. I'm no longer able to take away their lives most important currency. Time. Or on planet pit where pimple's face is on the back of this girl's back. Showing that he is in D.B. On the other end of the spectrum there's minimalist covers which I also love but these can be difficult for marketing depending on who you are. If you're big enough just the artist name can sell the album just Beyonce. Sometimes you don't even need the name. JZ's 444. I said it like it was a freaking windy's order. The JZ's 444 just says this is his 13th studio album. Who's? Who's? It's mine. A lot of artists use minimalist covers to establish a theme that kind of goes through multiple albums. Like run the jewels just their logo. 1975. That's punk. Nicky Minaj's pink print is just literally just her fingerprint. Just a stamp of our identity. The color is great dude. A minimalist cover with good color. At the end of the day though the music is essential to knowing how you feel about an album cover. Some covers just look bad and then pair with the combination of the music and time. They just fit perfectly with the album. Life Apollo was an example of a cover growing on me. I was so against this cover at first. I was like how did the man who gave us freaking graduation cover and my beautiful daughter to his fantasy cover. Give us this Microsoft paint cover. I hated it so much. I was like going in and changing it to a bunch of random different fan covers. This cover became so iconic. That's just how I was used everywhere. Every freaking H&M Forever 21 had their own version of that kind of text. Now listening to it this artwork is a perfect visual for Kanye's mental state on this album. This man was all over the place. I couldn't figure out if he could choose his family or the entertainment industry. And the color just looks like ultra light being. View is the same thing. I feel like this cover encapsulates the feeling of listening to a Drake album more than any other Drake album. This joint dropped in late April so I didn't get a chance to really feel the cover until it became winter again. But as soon as that winter time it I could appreciate the cold feeling of the album. Damn I felt like I was really driving around and snowy dark place. But yeah I wanted to make a video talking about album covers. You guys seemed to like the last video I did about music. And since I love music so much I was like I should be making more videos about this. You know of course I couldn't talk about every single piece of album artwork out there. So what are some album covers that have impacted you? What are some covers that make you feel a little tingly inside? Let me know in the comments down below. Let's be honest whatever you guys name is not gonna top. Play the pit.",

        "text": "I'm not a little brat who's like, I want to give my hair makeup done when I'm in bed. I promise you, this just worked out for everybody. Although I am kind of loving it, so I might continue to do that. Moving forward. Music Hi, Vogue. I'm Emma Chamberlain. Come hang out with me in Copenhagen today. Is I get ready for the Gany Show or Gany Show, depending on what type of mood you're in? Let's hang out. This is my very first Copenhagen trip and my very first Copenhagen fashion week. And I'm very, very excited because I just love experiencing new places. And I just don't think I would have come here as soon if it weren't for this. And I also, I love Gany. So this is just like, so exciting. It's time to go in Copenhagen. A lot of people are riding bikes. So I decided to participate. I'm not like super well trained yet, but I mean, not too bad. I can do a trick too much. She stands? Oh God. We're starting out today at Jerome's vintage. This is a very beautiful vintage store. This is amazing. But I'm also, oh God. Oh no. It's going to happen again too. It's going to happen multiple times. Come on. Okay, we're not touching that. That cannot be touched, not even by air. When I'm thrifting, I'm looking for things that make my brain light up. You know, when you, when you see a piece and you're like, ooh, what can I do with that? You know, that's a good sign. Keep an open mind and spend a lot of time in there. It's a scavenger hunt. Be patient, make a day out of it. Go and get coffee with your friends after. Enjoy. That is so, oh my God. It's a jacket. I see like, imagine me trying to get this home with only a carry on. Like, I'd have to wear that on the plane. Like, this looks like fun, fettie cake. Like, I want to eat it. Things need to stop coming off the hanger. Oh, look at it! That's foreshadowing because you know where we're going tonight. This was fun. It was like coming into a gallery looking at vintage fashion, some serious fashion. We got some serious brands in here. You know, this is just inspo for me to clock in my head for when I go shopping and I'm home and I didn't just bring a carry on to Europe for a month. After the next spot, it's coffee time. We're going to eat Hello Cafe and we're going to have a little coffee break. Okay, you can tell that I'm like a true bike riding gal because I have the the grease marks on my pants. Coffee time. But today, I get to make my own coffee. This beautiful cafe told me I could come in and make my own coffee because I'm supposed to be a pro because I do have a coffee company. But I'm not a trained barista. I'm a home barista. You know, the technique's different. We'll see if it translates. First, we need to make espresso. We have to bang this out. We're doing a double shot because I don't play around. Put it here. Elbow up. Press it. Put it in. Oh, I did the wrong one. Is that one? Yes, it is, Ellen. There we go. I know that the salmon milk based solely on the fact that there is an almond on the front. Otherwise, I don't have no idea what this is. Double shot of espresso here. Oh, it's so good. Step one, pour the espresso. Done. Step two, Mandel Drick. Final touch. A little bit of almond milk. I loved everything about the past five minutes. Today, I got to fulfill my wildest dream of being a barista. And it's delicious. If you know me, you know that this is my favorite fruit. It's a plum. These look absolutely incredible. These are like probably some of the most beautiful plums I've ever seen. I love this place. So next stop, rat, run a torn, run a torn, whatever. Okay, let's go. That came off really well. Okay, get normally a spill coffee on myself and then it's their whole day, but that was actually good luck. Cheers. They were on their way up. It's very loud in here. I am tired though. Like this is a workout for sure. I like to put her on the ground. I'm kidding. This actually cool. But my quads are burning. It's never ending. I'm jam-lagged. I'm like, things are getting narrow. It's getting narrow in here. So beautiful. I need to take a photo. I'm sorry. I know. It's like I'm on the stop. I have to. I have to. Unfortunately, this one's for my mom. But I love that about places. It's like the architecture is different. The view is different. It's like, yeah, Mr. Captain obvious. What I just said this song is, but I'm blocking the view from people. So I need to go. We're experiencing a bumpy ride right now. Oh my god. Riding a bike on these stones. It's not ideal, but we are at the Gany H. Q. It's time for a fitting. Hey! Nice to see you. How are you? Good. Good. Good. Look at the coke. My evening. Gany show. I'm so excited. Let's take a look. So this is a new collection. It's a fall winter collection. So we have very nice pieces. And I already see you have the best. I know. I know. I've got a sneak cart again. Oh my god. It comes in a cart again. Whoa. See, it's like, this is summer vibe. This is like the fall vibe. Yeah. You know, I will say that my favorite piece from the collection is the stress. When I go with mini dresses, I like high boots. Oh, say 1000%. Yeah. I think it kind of needs to be these because it's kind of leaning into the red of Levi's. Yes. That is so what bag? It's hard to choose, right? I like this. I was thinking. You like it as well? Yeah. One of these. Although that kind of looks like gardening vibe. Yeah. More than this one. And the whole vibe of this. You're gardening. So I kind of actually think we have to do that one. Yeah. There she is. There's the look. We're leaving. I think you should meet the best. Yes. Did it? Yes. Right there. Hey. So great to meet you. Everything is so beautiful. Thank you so much. Tonight's going to be really fun. It is, I'm very nervous, but I'm also looking very much forward. No, don't be nervous. Everything looks amazing that I've seen so far. I'm excited to get a little surprised though by some stuff too. That's sure they will be. Okay. Good. Good. I'm going to warn you everything we're about to say for the next remainder of this video might be a little out of pocket. You know, because I'm so tired, then I'm kind of getting a little punchy. I know for sure I'm going to see the Gany Levi's collab today at the show because I shot the campaign with them. I already know all the pieces. So I kind of had a sneak peek naturally. But other than that, you know, I don't go into a show with any expectation. I'm like, listen, I want to be shocked and wowed and see something that I could have never expected. And that's kind of the magic of going to shows. Here's the look. We're going to the Gany show. We're here. Thank you. I will send say thank you. Sometimes my manners run away from me. Help. Beautiful. It's like golden hour. Everybody's like in a bikini, like hanging out. It's a it's a vibe out here for sure. This is very different than Paris, but I can get used to this. I am the first attendee. Yay. Oh, I get a little box. What's in my little box? Chalk. Oh, I love it. I want to draw. Okay, just a small cat. Nobody's going to know. Like this is like don't literally don't tell anyone. Putting a heart around my own name. Yeah, not a good little bit conceited in retrospect, but it's too late. I've never been this early to a show. I've never been the first one to a show. It's like being the first one to a birthday party. So weird feeling. It's a vulnerable feeling. Listen, but nobody can say I'm not punctual. This is about the time when I go on my phone and act busy. And everybody's like, oh Emma's like Emma got here early so she could sit down and go on her phone for an hour, like in responding emails. No, no, she's doing emails. She wasn't like uncomfortably early. No, she's doing emails. Look at me. I'm doing emails. I'm actually not. I'm texting my mom. What's new? I'm just going to do a video and then maybe send me a picture. Okay, great. See, I can do my runway walk for you. The show is amazing. I'm exhausted, but it was a beautiful show. I had such an amazing day in Copenhagen. Thank you for hanging out. And thank you, Boog. Talk to you soon, Boog. Love you, Boog. Bye, Boog.",

        "text": "Hi there my name is John fish, and I'm a Harvard student I'm a freshman studying computer science And this video is going to be a day in my life and the first thing we're doing today. It's about 7:30 a.m. I'm gonna go grab some breakfast So Annenberg is Harvard's freshman dining hall, and honestly, it's like something out of Harry Potter. It's pretty cool. Morning Luke. Okay, it's now 8:15 a.m.. And my first class begins at 9:00, so I have like 45 minutes. I do have homework for that class that I haven't done yet, just like a little bit like a page. So I'm gonna do that, it's Swedish. And then, the other thing that I like to do with my mornings is just plan out my day so I have a growth book, it's what I call it's like a little daily planner agenda where I write over my schedule for the day my goals my motivation stuff like that, so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna do my homework. and then we'll get to class. All right, so just walking you through kind of what my scheduling might look like for a day. This is my schedule for the day. You know, wake up, do some homework, go to Swedish, go to math, have some lunch, go to lecture for my CS course today It's a guest lecture which should be cool. Then I work out, eat some dinner, go to work and then go to bed hopefully like 10:00 p.m ..um..That's the goal that's one of my goals for today is to hit nine hours of sleep. I've already meditated which is great. I want to read around 50 pages of my book throughout the day and then of course I want to film this video, so this is a daily planner that I have personally designed and that I'm actually making, I actually just Had a company produce a bunch of them and they're going to be shipped to Amazon. Hopefully within the next month and they'll be available on Amazon Prime and stuff like that and so if you want to buy one I Definitely recommend signing up for my newsletter the link for that is in my description and you'll be able to Pick up one of these when they come out. Oh, and check out the cover on that bad boy look at that Mmm, ooh Embossed logo, okay. I should do homework Alright so off to Swedish now It's actually like 9:02 But I'm gonna be on time because one of the interesting things about how Harvard classes work is that they all start on Harvard time, which is seven minutes past the hour Or seven minutes past when the class is supposed to start, so I'll be there on time even though I'll probably get there like 9:06. There's Widener Library by the way. It's a pretty cool library Alright, so that was an hour of Swedish. It is now 10:00 a.m, so I'm headed off to linear algebra. It's across campus I'm gonna kinda have to rush to get there in seven minutes, but usually I'm able to do it in like six or seven So many tourists All right rolling back from lunch now I've got an hour for my class which is a guest lecture at the computer science course Which is what the title of this video is a computer science student. That's me and so Yeah, I'm gonna kill some time. Maybe start an essay, maybe work on a problem set, maybe edit a video I got a lot of things on my to-do list. So the lecture today is for my functional programming class it's called CS51 And it's a guest lecture which is kind of cool. He's from Jane Street. Which is like an investment firm I believe they use OCaml, which is like one of the only actual firms in the world or companies that Uses the language which is the language that we use - it's a functional programming language, so I'm really interested to hear I don't even know what the lecture is gonna be on But I've heard that it's supposed to be one of the best lectures of the year for the course So I'll actually go to this one in person. Just gonna head over there in like 50 minutes and in the meantime probably going to edit a video Very very cool lecture and not just because they gave us free shirts although that was cool, too Thanks, Jane Street. But just a cool lecture Yeah, I thought it was actually pretty insightful in terms of just like cool like programming practices that he gave us Things like how to write code that literally you can't express errors which I thought was a very interesting concept the idea being like you need to design your Types, so OCaml is a typed language And when you're designing your custom types Doing so in a way that is literally impossible to write invalid or to write an invalid state In the examples that he gave with that were really interesting so Now the next thing that I have to do I have to go work out And I'm not allowed to talk about that on camera on my youtube channel, so instead, here's just some cinematic shots that I took of Harvard and its surrounding area. Alright, I'm back from working out. Time to go grab a bite to eat for dinner and then attempt to grind for a little bit Okay, so it's now 7:20 p.m.. And I've got a bunch of work to do so what I'm going to be working on right now is I've got an essay that I need to be writing for tomorrow. Just like a little rough draft I don't even think it's due until tomorrow at midnight, and I'm gonna be starting at psets I have nothing really due tomorrow which is great But I'm just gonna be be working on a bunch of different things. Okay, so the essay that I'm writing It's a literature review that is based off of this book flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi I think that's how you say his last name, but correct me if I'm wrong. The fundamental premise of the book is How do you find happiness in a world where we really struggle to do that? It seems like everyone wants to be happy Right, but over the thousands of years that we've progressed We haven't really become that much happier as people and so the question is well, what does make you happy and In flow that question is answered with the idea of meaningful work That is if you have a task that fulfills... Csik Mihaly breaks it down into eight different things eight different Categories that have task fits and then it's a flow activity and semion flow So you can apply this to anything and Csik Mihaly applied that to an entire life Saying that if you create one goal for your entire life And then you structure your life around that it with Goals and with sub goals and so on then you can have one life that is just a flow experience and therefore it will be an enjoyable experience and a happy experience Now what I'm looking at in my essay is how do you apply that to the student - to the education system? Because I believe that the education system is... well, it's pretty messed up to be honest I feel like a lot of students are miserable and That shouldn't be the case like school should be an enjoyable experience It should be fun and I think that you can make it fun, and I think that there's a way to do that with flow So I'm gonna go write my essay and then once I've written my essay there will be a video as a component to it That's actually part of the course which is really cool We go to one of the studios on campus, and we fillm a mini TED talk. So if you're interested I'll upload that video to this channel, so if you're not subscribed definitely subscribe because well Hopefully it'll be a useful video essay for you, and if not I upload video essays every week So I'm sure there will be something in there that you find useful. Anyways. I'm gonna go write this essay Okay, the essay, it's going pretty well. I have been writing for about an hour I am I'm getting a little tired though, so I'm gonna change gears I'm gonna do some math for a bit because I've got a problem set due in a couple days So I'm going to do a little bit of linear algebra for year series - for year - FOUR years. I'm gonna some some linear algebra Now another thing that I can imagine a lot of people are wondering is that for a computer science student I didn't do a whole lot of coding today, and that's actually true, and it's kind of a factor of Harvard being a liberal arts school So the courses that I'm taking our Swedish, Expos, which is a writing course Linear algebra and CS51. That's it There's just four courses And if you're coming from a technical college background like me coming from Canada Where pretty much every school is a technical college, and you take like eight courses a semester, and they're all pretty much given to you Yeah, it'd be kind of ridiculous to be taking a course like Swedish or to be taking a writing course but I kind of love it because Yes programming is fun But I think that overall The point of school is to make you develop as a person like you're you're trying to make people that are better members of Society and I don't think that Becoming only a better coder will make you a better person necessarily I think that there's so much more life than that. So it's like 9 o'clock - well, 9:05, and I'm going to start reading and brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed to try and be in bed for 10 o'clock because, maner of the sleep waking up at 7:00 just Gotta go to bed early. But before I head to bed I'd like to talk to you about the sponsor of this video. As a computer science student sometimes Listening to the lectures isn't enough for me to understand the things that I'm trying to learn. To actually understand a concept I have to reinforce what's being taught by doing problems And that's why I love the sponsor of this video Brilliant.org. Brilliant has a wide variety of interesting math and science problems and courses that can help you to both Reinforce what you're learning and to learn new things for example when my CS51 class went over red black binary trees I was able to work through the course that Brilliant has on them to clear up my confusion from the lecture and best of all when I got problems wrong I was able to Look at a detailed solution and understand what went wrong in my thought process and then fix it Then when it actually came to implementing a red black tree I didn't have to go searching through all sorts of reference materials. Brilliant had taught me all of the concepts that I needed to know. It's genuinely a really effective system So if you're interested in signing up for Brilliant.org, check out the link in my description to sign up for free and Also the first two hundred of my viewers that decide to upgrade will actually get 20% off their premium annual plan It's now 10pm So I'm gonna head to bed because I'm getting up at 7 tomorrow and one of my goals for the day was to hit Nine hours of sleep. Yeah pretty pretty uneventful day pretty average day I hope that you enjoyed this video of a day in my life I hope that you got to see a little bit of insight into what it is to be a student in freshman year at Harvard and Yeah, thank you so much for watching. I will see in the next video Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already because I make videos every week sometimes probably more, okay, bye",
