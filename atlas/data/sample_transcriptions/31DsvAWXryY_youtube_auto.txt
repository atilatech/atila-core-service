John's leading scorer in the league
double team download a Christian one
back out hard away for the lead he gets
knocked down Lakers have it
shot clock is three ahead of the game
they should wait they shoot the ball and
17 on the clock and they're going to
kill a little time with Schroeder
Schroeder goes all the way to the back
corner got to get it above
[Applause]
Dallas is challenging the foul called on
the play it's unsuccessful because
Reggie Bullock still committed the foul
however he did foul Russell Westbrook
so Russell Westbrook will be shooting
the penalty free throws two for two
big it's like a quarterback we want to
hear the snap
[Applause]

it again tonight at 101. that's to where
you change step back three-pointer over
a shorter Defender he's I've seen him do
that so so many times and on the line

blocked we're going to overtime unless
there was a foul call for saying no
LeBron gets the double team throws it
over

from that angle
did Hardaway get a piece of him
I've said it many times they don't like
to call fouls to end games to end
quarters that looked like a foul but
they say no there's no challenge
available you just go ahead Beholder
yeah the only Solace with Dodge hitch
[Applause]

hard foul by Russ without
LeBron in the middle of a mix
well he's been down at this end talking
to the referees near the Dallas bench
numerous times and Russell Luther
you saw Russ come over
gives him a that's a hip shot yeah and
that's why I'm saying will they talk
about it and say is that a basketball
play
ER shot him down
and then of course emotions running High
yeah
foul penalty one
in addition to being a transition take
foul so anyone on Dallas can shoot two
free throws then it'll be Dallas ball
front court with 24 on the shot clock

percentage from the line
the Lakers are shooting

finds Dodgers with three with two it's
going to be Hardaway Junior rebound
LeBron they just hit the lead in The
Ball by the way Junior misses the corner

Dinwiddie has taken over the offense
Spencer Dinwiddie with the dribble Big
Time defensive style so they're going to

protecting the rim broad body have a
layup
Ken witty

hoop here well when Yen right down the
middle to throw it down who was the last
line of defense that waved yeah he's
been wave in the flag the whole second
half seemingly but on this end of the
floor that's the guy you want

clocks at nine
Bullock on its way tap control over the
top yeah
the left-handed dribble is in the front
Court we got to go quick cheer down
three well LeBron's gonna fire for the
tie not there rebound Powell and he
finds Hardaway
try to foul right away and so we'll see
how quickly they foul they've got to get
it in and then when he does find it in
and Away hit the line he's missed four
free throws what are you going to give
it to Bullock Bullock doubled up
foreign
for three no rebound Dallas Lakers are
going to lose it
Dr Chas it that's why I thought you
