- I'm not a little brat.
who's like I wanna get my hair
and makeup done when I'm in bed.
I promise you, this just
worked out for everybody.
Although, I'm kind of loving it.
So I might continue to
do that moving forward.
[gentle bright music]
- Hi, Vogue.
I'm Emma Chamberlain,
come hang out with me
in Copenhagen today as I
get ready for the Ganni show
or Ganni show depending on
what type of mood you're in.
Let's hang out.
[quirk music]
This is my very first Copenhagen trip
and my very first Copenhagen Fashion Week.
And I'm very, very excited,
because I just love
experiencing new places.
And I just don't think
I would've come here
as soon if it weren't for this.
And also, I love Ganni,
so this is just like so exciting.
It's time to go.
In Copenhagen, a lot of
people are riding bikes.
So, I decided to participate.
I'm not like super well trained yet,
but I mean, not too bad.
I can do a trick too, watch.
She stands.
Oh God.
[relaxed music]
We're starting out today
at Jerome's Vintage.
This is a very beautiful vintage store.
This is amazing, but I'm also...
Oh God.
Oh no.
It's gonna happen again too.
It's gonna happen multiple times.
Come on.
Okay, we're not touching that.
That cannot be touched, not even by air.
When I'm thrifting,
I'm looking for things that
make my brain light up.
You know when you see a
piece and you're like, ooh,
what can I do with that?
That's a good sign.
Keep an open mind and spend
a lot of time in there.
It's a scavenger hunt.
Be patient, make a day out of it,
go and get coffee with your friends after.
Enjoy.
That is so...
Oh my God, it's a jacket.
[gasps] Whoa.
See, like imagine me
trying to get this home
with only a carry-on.
Like I'd have to wear that on the plane.
Like this looks like funfetti cake.
Like I want to eat it.
Things need to stop coming off the hanger.
Oh, look who it's.
That's foreshadowing,
because you know where
we're going tonight.
This was fun.
It was like coming into a gallery
looking at vintage fashion,
some serious fashion.
We got some serious brands in here.
This is just inspo for
me to clock in my head
for when I go shopping,
and I'm home and I didn't
just bring a carry-on
to Europe for a month.
Off to the next spot.
[upbeat music]
It's coffee time.
We're going to Italo Caffe,
and we're gonna have
a little coffee break.
Okay, you can tell that I'm
like a true bike riding gal,
because I have the
grease marks on my pants.
[upbeat jazz music]
Coffee time.
But today I get to make my own coffee.
This beautiful cafe
told me I could come in
and make my own coffee, because
I'm supposed to be a pro,
because I do have a coffee company,
but I'm not a trained barista.
I'm a home barista.
The technique's different.
We'll see if it translates.
First we need to make espresso.
We have to bang this out.
We're doing a double shot,
because I don't play around.
Put it here, elbow up, press it,
put it in.
Oh, I did the wrong one.
Is it that one?
Yes, it is that one.
There we go.
I know that this is almond milk
based solely on the fact
that there is an almond on the front.
Otherwise I would have
no idea what this is.
Double shot of espresso here.
Ugh, so good.
Step one, pour the espresso.
Done.
Step two, mandel drik.
Final touch, a little bit of almond milk.
I loved everything about
the past five minutes.
Today I got to fulfill my
wildest dream of being a barista.
And it's delicious.
If you know me,
you know that this is my favorite fruit.
It's a plum.
These look absolutely incredible.
These are like probably some
of the most beautiful plums
I've ever seen.
I love this place.
[upbeat music]
So next stop, Rundetaarn,
Rundetaarn, whatever.
Okay, let's go.
[upbeat music]
That came off really well.
Okay, good.
Normally I just full coffee on myself,
and then it's there all day,
but that was actually good luck.
Cheers.
Okay, we're on our way up.
It's very loud in here.
I am tired though.
Like this is a workout for sure.
I liked it better on the ground.
I'm kidding, this is actually cool,
but my quads are burning.
It's never ending.
I'm jet lagged.
It's not my fault.
Things are getting narrow.
It's getting narrow in here.
[upbeat music]
So beautiful.
I need to take a photo.
I'm sorry.
I know, I know.
It's like, Emma, stop.
I have to.
I have to, unfortunately.
This one's for my mom.
But I love that about places.
It's like the architecture is different.
The view is different.
It's like, yeah, Mr. Captain Obvious.
What I just said is so obvious,
but I'm blocking the view
from people, so I need to go.
We're experiencing a bumpy ride right now.
Oh my God.
Riding a bike on these stones, [groans]
it's not ideal, but we
are at the Ganni HQ.
It's time for a fitting.
[upbeat music]
Hey.
- Emma, nice to see you.
- How are you?
- I'm good and you?
- I'm good.
- Welcome to Copenhagen
and Ganni Showroom.
- I'm so excited.
Let's take a look.
So this is the new collection.
- It's a fall winter collection,
so we have very nice pieces
and I already see you have the vest.
- I know, I got a sneak peek.
- I have the cardigan.
- Oh my God, it comes in a cardigan?
- So you can do that as well.
- Whoa.
See it's like, this is summer vibe.
This is like the fall vibe.
- Yeah, I love it.
- I will say that my favorite
piece from the collection
is this dress.
- The yellow dress.
When I go with mini
dresses, I like high boots.
- Oh, same, 1,000%.
I think it kind of needs to be these,
because it's kind of leaning
into the red of Levi's.
That is so cute.
- You should try this.
- What bag?
- It's hard to choose, right?
I like this, because I think...
You like this one?
- Yeah, one of these.
- You prefer.
- [Emma] Although that kind
of looks like gardening vibe,
more than this one,
and the whole vibe of this
gardening is gardening.
So I kind of actually think
we have to do that one.
- This one with the boots?
- Yeah, there she is.
There's the look.
- Before leaving, I think
you should meet [indistinct],
our creative director.
- Yes.
- I'll put the bag here.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hi.
- So great to finally meet you.
- So great to meet you.
Everything is so beautiful.
- Thank you so much, Emma.
- [Emma] Tonight's gonna be really fun.
- It is.
I'm very nervous, but I'm also
looking very much forward.
- No, don't be nervous.
Everything looks amazing
that I've seen so far.
I'm excited to get a
little surprised, though,
by some stuff too.
- True, there will be.
- Okay, good, good.
[relaxed music]
- I'm gonna warn you,
everything I'm about to say
for the next remainder of this video
might be a little out of
pocket, because I'm so tired
that I'm kind of getting a little punchy.
I know for sure I'm going to
see the Ganni Levi's collab
today in the show.
Because I shot the campaign with them,
I already know all the pieces,
so I kind of had a sneak peek naturally.
But other than that,
I don't go into a show
with any expectation.
I'm like, listen, I wanna
be shocked and wowed
and see something that I
could have never expected,
and that's kind of the
magic of going to shows.
Here's the look.
We're going to the Ganni how.
[upbeat music]
We're here.
Thank you.
I almost didn't say thank you.
Sometimes my manners run away from me.
How beautiful.
It's like golden hour.
Everybody's like in a
bikini like hanging out.
It's a vibe out here for sure.
This is very different
than Paris Fashion Week.
I can get used to this.
Hi.
- Hi, How are you?
- I am the first attendee.
- You are the first.
Maybe we'll do another show.
This is for you.
- Yay.
- Yay.
- Oh, I get a little box.
What's in my little box?
Chalk.
Oh, I love it.
I wanna draw.
- Just a small tag.
- Okay, just a small tag.
Like nobody's gonna know.
- We won't tell anyone.
- Don't.
Literally don't tell anyone.
[relaxed music]
Putting a heart around my own name,
eh, not a good...
A little bit conceited in
retrospect, but it's too late.
I've never been this early to a show.
I've never been the first one to a show.
It's like being the first
one to a birthday party.
It's a weird feeling.
It's a vulnerable feeling.
Listen, but nobody can
say I'm not punctual.
This is about the time when I
go on my phone and act busy.
Like everybody's like, oh, Emma's busy.
Like Emma got here early,
so she could sit down and
go on her phone for an hour
and respond to emails.
No, no, no, she's doing emails.
She wasn't like uncomfortably early.
No, she's doing emails.
Look at me, I'm doing emails.
I'm actually not.
I'm texting my mom.
What's new?
- I'm just gonna do a video
and then maybe some pictures.
- Okay, great.
See, I can do my runway walk for you.
- [Photographer] Oh, yes, yes.
[upbeat music]
Wow.
[upbeat music]
[upbeat music]
[audience applauds]
- The show was amazing.
I'm exhausted, but it
was a beautiful show.
I had such an amazing day in Copenhagen.
Thank you for hanging out.
And thank you, Vogue.
Talk to you soon, Vogue.
Love you, Vogue.
Bye, Vogue.
