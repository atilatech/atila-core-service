What point game stuff Dallas down by one.
Gotcha leading score in the lead.
Double team down motor Christian one.
Back out by the way for the lead.
He gets knocked down.
Lakers have it.
Shot clock is three ahead of the game.
K.
Shouldn't wait.
They should pull in 17 on the clock.
And kill all the time with Shrutta.
Shrutta goes all the way to the back.
The ball is going to get the shot.
Get it above.
Shrutta gets it to Ross.
Dallas is challenging the foul called on the play.
Unsuccessful because Reggie Bull had still committed the foul.
However, he did follow Russell Westbrook.
So Russell Westbrook will be shooting the penalty free throws.
Two so two big.
It's like a quarterback.
We want to hear the snap.
To give the Lakers a three point lead.
Got him both.
Time out.
Got him both.
The Lakers lead by three.
11.8.
Have a number of chips.
A three.
Down right now.
Down three.
They advanced the basketball.
They give it to Johnson.
Johnson.
He's going to fire the three from the time.
Got it.
First points of the corner.
Dotchitz does it again.
A tie to one.
Oh, that's why I said that's to where you choose.
Step back three pointer over a shorter defender.
He's I've seen him do that so.
So many time on the line.
This guy is he is money.
What a move.
First points of the quarter.
He's got a 30 point triple double.
Oh, really.
Here we go six seconds left tie again.
It's up to LeBron.
LeBron's got it.
LeBron over to Troy Brad to win the game.
It was blocked.
We're going over time unless there was a foul call.
No, but saying LeBron gets to double T.
Frozen over.
Whoa, whoa.
That looked like a foul from that angle.
Did hardaway get a piece of him.
I've said it many times.
They don't like to call fouls to end games to end quarters.
That look like a foul.
But they say no.
There's no challenge available.
If you just go ahead.
The only solid with Dotchitz.
The choice of me.
That's how you run off.
Please.
You got to call by.
Is this will be this will be.
All of us can stop.
Look at.
Look at.
Look at.
Well, they're going to probably talk to the show because they're going to want to go close this a basketball point.
Hard foul by Russ without.
Now LeBron in the middle of the mix.
What he's been down at this end talking to the referees.
Here the guy was bench numerous times and wrestling with them.
And saw Russ come over.
Gives him.
That's a good job.
Yeah.
That's why I'm saying were they talk about it and say if I was that a basketball play.
And then of course a motion is running high.
Well, we're going to go up to a playground.
Kind of the one.
In addition to being a transition take foul.
So anyone on Dallas can shoot two free throws and then he'll be Dallas ball front court with 24 on the shot clock.
And bird who's three out of five.
Is a shooting a better percentage from the line.
The Lakers are shooting a game.
Again.
Still well.
He's in trouble.
He finds.
Josh it's with three with two.
It's going to be out of a junior.
Three ball.
LeBron.
Because with the lead in the ball.
Junior misses the corner three.
The ball.
Looks to get to the basket.
Warding off the defender.
Close it up.
On the line.
Two big ones for LeBron James.
And it's one away.
105.
This is the guy now.
sister over.
Over playing.
Luca.
Didn't would he has taken over the offense.
That's a good way.
With the credit being tied.
Defense have stopped.
They've got to be held.
Come here.
He's too small for Luca.
We'll go.
Step back to fire.
If he can.
There it is.
There's the throw.
He's got it again.
Unreal.
Number 77.
Luca.
Dotchets.
One away.
One away.
This crowd is buzzing and marveling.
What.
Dotchets is done with the Lakers are tied.
With 46 seconds remaining.
Not to just 33.
13 and 13.
The crowd going to lead.
Oh.
It was around.
It still's out.
You got about getting down.
Wow.
Now you got to make sure your defense is on point.
Shot.
Drop.
13 ahead of the game.
For the lead.
Not going to get it.
Lakers can work for the last shot.
The broadcast lets go.
We're not calling time out.
Crowd on its feet.
Tieder one away.
LeBron with the basketball.
With a two to two this seven.
He's going to attack.
Dotchets.
The front James gets brought.
We bow.
We're going to go double over time.
Those baseline.
Those to the other side of the rim.
So to get contact on the arm.
There he did.
He got a little.
LeBron in the second overtime.
West foot.
He's got a three.
And the Lakers have the lead.
Yes.
Sir.
No hesitation at all.
He just caught in left.
Fly.
The first one for.
Did ready.
They didn't really go to his left.
I just withdraw Brown to stand.
Dotchets scores.
That was a second day defender.
But didn't put up much resistance.
There's no foul.
That's the ninth lead.
James.
The reward is now.
But he blocks the shot.
The.
He needs out.
He definitely needs out.
The other end.
He had a really score.
He got one can continue.
Boy.
I tell you what both teams.
Excuse me as Christian would.
Makes the play a defensive block.
And the shot of Russell Westbrook.
And all of a sudden.
So appreciate it.
He's had.
He's talking.
What again.
Westbrook.
He wants to just now.
The three and moment of.
It's 44.
Play.
They top it.
Here we go.
So.
Block by one again.
What has been a monster.
Underneath protecting the rim.
Block by.
La.
Kid.
Now.
Luke.
Dotchets.
And it's 20 to play.
Dotchets 17 for.
And out.
And our Lakers get a little bit of a kick there.
That's one to Dotchets.
Normally not to down.
Hard away.
And look like a leader.
Culver.
You can't call for.
You do.
Garvin was looking at the bond.
Say not.
You get one.
One on one.
Under a minute to play.
And it's now a five point game.
Dyer straits.
Well under a minute.
Dotchets.
Dotchets.
Got a score.
And the up to score.
You got to get a big hoop here.
Well when.
Right down the middle to throw it down.
Who's the last line of defense.
And way.
Yeah.
These are the way.
The flag.
The whole second half.
See me.
But on this end of the floor.
That's the guy you want.
The three point game.
It's a one possession game.
Shot clock's at nine.
Bullock.
On its way.
Tap control.
Over to top.
Yeah.
The bond with the left hand and dribble is in the track for.
You got to go quick.
You're down three.
Well the ball is going to fire for the tie.
Not there.
Three bound power.
Only five.
Got to follow.
Right over there.
So we'll see how quickly they found.
They've got to get it in.
And did what he does find it in.
And the way.
The line.
He has four free throws.
We're going to give it to Bullock.
Well.
Double.
Double.
Double.
Got to lift the game.
Well the bond for three.
No rebound.
Don't think it's going to lose it.
Got to chas it.
That's why I thought you needed to compete.
They weren't going to foul you.
And the Lakers don't even foul games over.
Dallas.
Double overtime.
Victory over the Lakers.
The water game.
Everybody left it all.
The water game.
